There are many things that are certain in my relationship. One of the main things that I'm certain about is the bond we have with each other. I believe the bond we have is unbreakable. We've known each other from the ages of 12 and 14. Another thing I'm certain about is that we're getting married June 2019. We both waited a long time for that day and it'll be here soon. Although my relationship is perfect there is one thing that I'm uncertain about. I'm uncertain about 20 years from now is her feelings going to change? She hasn't really been with anyone throughout her life and I wonder would she go through a phase where she just wants to try something new since she's been with me for so long. I read stories like that all the time from women who have been with their significant others for a long time and just think the grass is greener on the other side. Although I feel that my relationship is perfect there is one thing that I'm uncertain about. Experiences a divorce is something that I would not want to go through. From the financial outcomes to the emotional ones.,3,5.5,3,4,5,6,6
"One of the things i am certain about in our relationship is how much we love each other. I know that my partner loves me very much because she always expresses it. She always tells me how much she loves me and also shows it to me as well. She is always willing to go the extra mile for me and is willing to help me whenever i need it. Even if something is bothering me or is affecting me negatively, she is willing to talk to me about it and help me fix it instead of abandoning me. One of the things that i am uncertain about is what bothers my partner at times. She is someone that likes to hide things from me because she doesn't want it to stress me out. If she is having a terrible day at work, she would often not saying anything about it but i can see the expression on her face that something is bothering her. Another thing that i am uncertain about in our relationship is how we deal with money. We don't really have any rules in our relationship regarding money. It's more so like we just take turns paying for things.",10,3,4,5,4,5,6
"We have been together for about 10 years and married for almost 6 years so we have a pretty good understanding of where we stand with each other. We love and respect each other. Our lives are fairly routine at this point and we have a good understanding of what the other is thinking most of the time. We still make time to talk with each other about whatever is happening in our lives. We are parents so obviously a large part of our life revolves around our children now. We still try to make a point of getting alone time with each other because that is vital in any relationship. I wouldn't say that there is much that I'm uncertain about because we pretty much always have an open line of communication going. I would say maybe the only time there's uncertainty is if there is a disagreement about something and sometimes one of us requires a cooling off period. So maybe in that time, there's some uncertainty about the issue until we talk again and get everything completely resolved. Other than that, I would say that we're pretty strong in most aspects. We make a point to keep things loose and open.",12,6,5,5,5,5,6
"The things in my three year relationship that I'm a certain about are my intentions, as well as the intentions of my partner. I feel that we both are one hundred percent sure that we love and respect each other. As a couple we are in agreement that we want to be together for the rest of our lives. In our relationship, we're both sure of each others needs, wants and desires. We both take the initiative everyday to make that a reality to for one another The love and respect between us is obvious and on full display.  The things that I am uncertain about in my relationship is my girlfriends behavior when she's not in my presence. Though I believe that we love and respect each other emotionally. Physical desires aren't necessarily connected to emotions. Plenty of people in committed relationships have affairs. I would not say that this is a thought that worries me, but it is definitely a concern. I have no way of knowing if this type of infidelity is taking place. Which leads to a lot of uncertainty when i thinks about the possibility. I would like to think it isn't, but how could i know for sure.",13,4,3,4,5,6,6
"I am certain about how my partner and I feel about each other. We both love each other equally and agree that we are completely committed to each other. Neither of us has any intentions of ending the relationship or pursing other partners. We both want to stay together and are very happy with our current relationship, so I am also sure about our level of commitment to each other. One major thing I'm uncertain about is our view about marriage. I am not in a rush to get married again, and am very apprehensive about doing so. On the other hand, he wants to get married soon. I trust my feelings about him, but I know that things and feelings can change. I'm mostly concerned about his feelings changing after we get married. I don't want to get trapped in a marriage to someone who doesn't want to be married to me any more. I want to take our time and get married sometime in the future, but he thinks if I don't want to get married now I never will, which isn't true. I just want to be careful and have both of us absolutely sure that's what we want to do.",14,3.5,4,5,4,5,6
"I am certain that I love my wife, and that we have similar temperaments and personalities that compliment each other. I like spending time with her and enjoying activities with her. We like a lot of the same hobbies, and both have similar ideas about how to enjoy life. We like the outdoors, going camping, cooking meals together, watching Netflix or even doing puzzles. We are both introverted people and prefer doing things at home or in small social settings than to go to large parties or gatherings. The things that I am uncertain about though are related towards careers and where and how we would like to establish our lives. My wife is very invested in her career, and would like to move to a larger city to get a better job and have more opportunities available to her. I work in construction, and while I enjoy the work I do, I see it as more of a means to an end, to enjoy life. I would like some day to buy some land, have a large garden, and maybe own some animals. My wife doesn't want that at all. I can foresee that in the future we might have some conflicts around that.",16,5,3,5,4,6,6
"I feel that my relationship with my spouse is a good one.  We have been together for quite some time and feel stable.  I feel certain that I can discuss any issue with my partner.  We understand one another at this point and time and while we do argue, we still respect and love one another.  I feel certain that if there were any problems I would be able to discuss them and have my thoughts and feelings understood.  I cannot think of anything uncertain, we are best friends to be honest and work well together.  We have been together long enough I can tell when my partner needs to talk, or has something on his mind before he says anything at all.  The current state of our relationship is one that I am proud of, it has taken us a lot of time to be able to understand one another the way that we do.  I don't believe that either of us would remain in a relationship with one another if we didn't understand each other the way that we do or had any doubts or uncertainties about one another, there would really be no point to that if I am being fully honest",17,6,6,5,6,6,6
"The things I am certain about in my relationship - I am certain about our commitment to each. I am certain about the goals that we have for each other, for our relationship and for our careers. I am certain about the values that we have. I am certain about the expectations that we have for each other. I am certain about what we have in common and about what we have a different opinion about. I am certain about what we want for our future and how we make that happen. I am certain about how we feel about each and how much we love each other. I am certain about how we support each other. I am certain about how we protect each other. I am certain about our loyalty towards each other. I am certain about how we communicate in an honest way to each other. I am certain about how we fill each others needs and wants. I am certain about the trust we have in each other. I am uncertain about nothing in our relationship. We are not perfect and we have issues from time to time but uncertainty is not a problem for us. We believe and trust in each other.",23,6,6,5,6,6,6
"I am certain that I want to be with my husband for the rest of my life.  We have been together since we were 19 and have grown and matured together for 14+ years.  Having children has solidified these feelings, as he's a wonderful father.  We support each others needs and goals and work towards them together.  I truly feel like we are a team, and will work together to achieve whatever we want.  We are open and honest with each other, and whenever we are having a hard time we help build the other person up.  We are the 'soft place' for each other, that everyone needs, in this harsh world.  I can tell him my deepest thoughts and dreams and know he will only have good intentions.  I am certain my husband wants the best for me and will do what he can to get that. I don't have uncertainties in my relationship.  Everyone has gone through ups and downs, but we have never even come close to breaking up in all the years we've been together.  Sure we argue, but those true core 'issues' couples can have are not there.  We have always been loving and respectful to each other, even in heated disagreements.",24,6,6,5,6,6,6
"MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY LOVER IS VERY CERTAIN.BECAUSE SHE HAS THE MOST UNDERSTANDING PERSONALITY AND ALSO ME TO HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING.BECAUSE IN THE RELATIONSHIP UNDERSTANDING HAS THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE.SHE WAS GOOD LOOKING PERSONALITY BUT I DON'T AN EQUAL LEVEL OF PERSONALITY BUT STILL ALSO SHE LOVES ME VERY MUCH. WE HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP OVER TWO AND HALF YEARS BUT STILL ALSO SHE CARES ME AND I CARES HER VERY MUCH.AND ALSO SHE HAS MEET THE QUALITY WHAT I WANTS.AND ALSO EVERYBODY TOLD US TO ""MADE FOR EACH OTHER"".AND BOTH WE HAVE REALIZED OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE BETTER RELATIONSHIP.AND I LIKE HER VERY MUCH DUE TO SHE HAS A VERY HELPING TENDENCY TO OTHER.THIS HABIT I LIKE HER VERY MUCH.THERE IS SOME PROBLEMS ARISE TO BOTH US.BUT BOTH OF THEM READY TO ASK A SORRY TO EACH.SO,EVERY BIG PROBLEMS BETWEEN US GONE VERY QUICKLY.IN THE MONEY LEVEL WE BOTH ARE IN MIDDLE CLASS BUT THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF HAPPINESS BETWEEN US.DUE TO THE REASON FOR UNDERSTANDING.IN MY POINT OF VIEW IN A BETTER RELATIONSHIP UNDERSTANDING HAS THE MOST ROLE,THAT'S WHY I TOLD WE ARE HAPPY UNTIL OUR DEATH.",32,6,6,3,6,6,6
"My wife and I have been married for 7 years and been together for over 15, so we are pretty certain about our relationship.  We are both working towards a lot of the same goals both personally and family oriented.  We strive to improve our health, our financial situation, and the overall mental well-being.  My wife and I both know that we are each other‚Äôs soulmates and know we will be together forever.  Oure relationship has lasted this long because of our commitment to one another.  Overtime we have come to know each other very well and know the rules of our relationship including behaviors, how to communicate, and expectations of one another. I think the biggest uncertainty in our relationship revolves around the desired size of our family.  My wife and I currently have a four-year-old son and I am pushing for having one more child.  My wife, on the other hand, is a bit hesitant to start the process all over a raising a baby.  We keep the lines of communication open on this subject, but the decision is still up in the air.  I know that we will come to a decision that works for our family and a decision we can both agree upon.",39,5,4,5,5,6,6
"I have known my wife since I was 17 when we first started dating. Now at 41 we have been married for 6 yrs. We have literally been a couple for more years then we have not in our lives. There isn't much if anything we do not know about each other. How we feel about politics, favorite foods, type of movies we enjoy.  I do not have any uncertainty about any issues or future plans. I do not believe she does either. We will more then likely grow old together and continue to enjoy life together until we die of old age. We talk things through like a couple of adults, have for a very long time. We air any frustrations we may have in a calm manor and work through them best we can as a team.  We are both black sheeps in our family so we have learned well how to work together as it sometimes feels like it is use against the world. It use to be a drain on us when we were younger, so much work, especially when its coming from both sides. At this point though we go back to back inviting it to come as we both know we can more then handle everything.",43,6,6,4,6,6,6
"First of all, this relationship is stable and there are no uncertainties. I truly believe we both are on the same page. We are certain in all aspects of what is important in the future. We have decided when to get married for example. We have decided to try and have two children. We know when to give each other space, we respect each other and our work. We have goals separately and several in common. We have different groups of friends and many common friends. If any uncertainty arises in the future, I think that we both know how to process any questions and pose any doubts. We have talked extensively what we deserve and need to be happy. We have chosen to be with other because we make each other happy. If there are any disagreements we share them and compromise to find a solution. Life and love is about compromises to make each other happy. We are stubborn sometimes, nothing is perfect, but we are mature enough to get upset and wait until we cool off to talk. I guess the only uncertainty would be if i died today, I wouldnt be with her anymore. This is the most secure, adult relationship I have had, and I am the happiest.",44,6,5,5,6,6,6
"There is actually very little that I am uncertain about in my relationship.  I have been married to my husband for almost 20 years and we pride ourselves on our strong ability to communicate.  Very early on in our relationship we moved away from all of our family and have spent our entire adult lives relying on each other to get through all of the ups and downs that life has sent our way.  We are very proud of the strength of our relationship and both of us would say that each other is our best friend.  We both talk frequently and text during the day because we want to hear the other person's opinions on matters.  We'd both rather spend time with each other than with anyone else, excepting for our children.  We look forward to being with each other, we spend time each evening talking through things and making sure that we are on the same page regarding our lives, our parenting and our decisions.  We actively make plans for what our future will be because we are certain that we want to spend time together even more when we are able to finally retire.  Pretty much I have no doubts or concerns about this relationship at all, there are no uncertainties for us.",56,6,6,5,6,6,6
"We have known each other for a long time but when she was sngle I wasn't and when I was she wasn't and eventually we were available at the same time and the relationship took off fast. We have everything in common and rarely disagree on anything outside of what to get for dinner at the chinese restaurant. We both save our money and are both good at placing a value on items that need to be purchased so we get more for our money. We are able to talk about anything do to our years of friendship. Our sex interests are similar so no issues there, same type of music and movies. It's an ideal relationship. The only issue that would be uncertain is her job as she works for ATT and if she were told to move to Kansas City or Texas as part of her job, would we beable to stay a couple. I cetainly would not stop her and she would not want me to lose my position where I'm at to go with her as a couple. If a seperation instance popped up like that I am uncertain on if we would stay together or not. ATT does move managers around and it is a possibility though she has not experienced it yet.",60,4.5,4,4,4,6,6
"Things my wife and I are certain about in our relationship by far outweigh those we are uncertain about.  We are both certain about how much we love each other.  We are certain about how much we are happy, satisfied and content with our relationship.  We are certain about how we want this relationship to last the rest of our lives.  We are certain about how much we are on the same page about things like finances, child rearing and similar family matters.  We are certain about how we enjoy the same things like similar hobbies (gaming, soccer, golf, gardening).  We are certain how we support each other in our jobs (we are both in tech) and how we use our different disciplines to help each other in our respective jobs.  We are certain where we see ourselves in the future, both near and far. The things we are uncertain about is a very short list.  We are uncertain what will happen when one of us passes.  It is unpleasant to think about but something we should probably better prepare for just in case.  Another uncertainty is what we plan to do in retirement, we have some vague ideas but we haven't really put anything down in concrete as retirement is still a bit a ways off for us.",62,6,5,5,5,6,6
"I feel as though this relationship has changed me for the better, before I was more shy and didn't really go out and do much but since being with him I am more open to new experiences and meeting new people. I have also done a lot of things I didn't think I would ever do (going to Canada, meeting my favorite singer Kelly Clarkson, going to casinos). I know that one day we will get married. We are in love and have been for years. Neither of us have ever felt this way about anyone before. I also know that we will adopt kids one day because that is something we both want. The only thing I am uncertain about is how many kids we will adopt. I almost want two but he wants just one right now. This is something that one of us will have to change our minds about but I guess that is something we will talk about when the time comes. I am certain that one day we will move into a new house, in the same state but maybe a different city, and it will have a bigger backyard for a dog we will get one day. I am certain that he will want us to get another cat as well for our current cat to play with.",73,5.5,5,4,5,6,6
"My wife and I have been together for over 14 years now, and it started as a long distance thing for the first 2 years, which made defining the terms extremely important for us. If we didn't get on the same page about each of our roles and expectations, then it never would have lasted through those first couple of years when distance can create trust and intimacy issues. Once we were married and with each other every day in our own place, we further solidified those expectations and the roles we planned to occupy and pursue for the future of our relationship. The key was and is always communication. Even the closest couple can't be mind readers so it's extremely important to talk about things that are bothering you before they become a ""thing."" We are both committed to each other for the rest of our lives, and have financial and relationship goals mapped out all the way until retirement. The only uncertainty we ever seem to face are the challenges of parenting. Our son is a huge variable, and no amount of planning can prepare us for what he may or may not do. Once again, this is where communication is extremely important, as we must get on the same page to have any kind of hope of success as parents and as a couple.",77,5.5,5,5,5,5,6
"I have no uncertainties in my relationship with my husband. We are both Christians, and we put God first before anything or anyone else, even each other. We both pray for God's will to be done in our lives. We love each other, and we are each other's best friend as well. We even work together. We do have our own interests, but we have a lot of shared interests too. We pray together a lot, and we attend church and Bible study together. These three things strengthen our relationship with one another. We do have problems, mainly financial and health-related ones. We do not let this interfere with what we mean to each other though. We always have each other's back. This also is not to say we don't have our squabbles. I don't know a married couple alive who does not have them. We do irritate and frustrate each other now and again, because we both have strong personalities. We are quick to put it behind us though. We have never gone to bed angry or upset with one another, because that is just not who we are. We truly do have the best relationship with one another, and we are excited that it is an eternal relationship too! Putting God before ourselves is the reason we have such a successful and wildly happy relationship.",81,6,6,6,6,6,6
"I'm certain that we are a great team. We come from families that are passive-aggressive and terrible communicators so we have made it our priority to really make sure that we speak openly about everything - from things that make us happy, appreciation, goals, to things that bother us, annoy us, or seem like they could be issues down the road. We are certainly in love and absolutely plan on staying together for the rest of our lives. We are raising 2 beautiful children together, and that has really come with it's own issues, but I'm positive that there is no better person out there for either of us that is more doting, supportive, or aware of the other's needs. I'm certain that we know that being in a marriage is about helping each other in a way that makes each other's lives easier, love is simply not enough. We know that things aren't always 50/50, and we do our best to pick up each others slack when the other one isn't at their best. We don't keep tally of each other's faults.  I'm uncertain if there will be trials and tribulations down the line that we couldn't anticipate that may drive a wedge between us. While we work wonderfully together, I just can't know if there's something that we haven't experienced together that may cause issues that we can't work through. I would hope that something like this doesn't exist, but it's an uncertainty.",105,5,5,4,5,5,6
"I am certain that we are in love and committed, and will stay together forever.  We have been together for 18 years and happily married for 16 years.   We certainly have the same goals in raising our family and spending our lives together.  We certainly enjoy one anothers company and love to do things together.  We have common goals and love ""doing life together"".  I am certain that both my husband and I are happy and content in our relationship and want to be together for all time.  I am certain we are not ever going to part ways.  I am uncertain about the state of our relationship in regards to sexual attraction.  We have been together for a long time and it feels a bit more familiar, like friends, then a sexual relationship.  We are not intimate nearly as much as we used to be.  Although the romance and friendship are still there, the sexual aspect has been removed somewhat. I am also uncertain about out future goals, later in life, say 10 years from now.  We are in mid forties and have a daughter who will be off to college in 4 years.  What we will do as we are older adults is up in the air at this moment.  We havent discussed the reality of what we will do in retirement, when that will occur, or how we will finance it.",106,4.5,6,4,4,6,6
I am certain that we will last forever.  We still talk and touch like we did when we first got together.  We got married after knowing each other only six months and after 8 years we still feel the same about each other.  We have a strong bond and I do not see it ever breaking.  We have been through just about everything that could possibly tear us apart and are still standing strong.  We do fight and sometimes we do not speak for days at a time but that is not enough to tear us apart.  It makes our relationship stronger when we take the time to look at the other side of an argument.  We fight over how to raise our kids mainly.  I am the more stern parent and he is more laid back.  He says I am too mean to our kids.  This is what usually makes me more mad than anything.  I tell him he can not let them do what they want or they will not respect him.  We also argue about money a lot.  I will tell him there  will be a certain amount in the checking account after such and such clears.  Then he goes to the ATM and thinks that we have a different amount and goes out buying all kinds of crap.  Which then leads to a huge fight because I have to pull money from savings to buy gas and groceries until we get paid again.,107,5.5,5,3,5,6,6
"I believe that I tend to be certain about most things regarding my relationship with my significant other. We typically discuss openly our relationship and any issues we may have, which allows us a level of certainty in our relationship. We have also been together for quite a while, over four years, so we know each other quite well. Of what I am certain about, I am certain that my significant other cares about me. They have stayed with me for this long and have made sacrifices for me such as moving to a city near my hometown. This provides me certainty that they care. I am also certain about our commitment to the future. We are planning to be married in September and I am certain that we are both heavily invested in our future together. I am also certain about my partners preferences and moods. Being together for this long, I believe we both have a level of certainty about how to best communicate with one another and also how we are feeling.  Though I am relatively certain about most aspects of the relationship, of things I am less certain about, if I had to say, I would say sex would be one. We talk about it less than other things, perhaps because my partner is a bit shy about talking about such things. As a result, I have some uncertainty about their level of satisfaction. I am also a bit uncertain about whether my partner feels they have sacrificed in regards to their career for me by moving to an area I preferred.",118,5,5,4,5,6,6
"I have been in this relationship for 25 years. I am 100% certain that my husband loves me. I know for sure he would NEVER cheat on me. I also know that I can confide in him when I need to. I know if my health gets bad, he will be there for me.  I also know he would never lie to me or hurt me. I don't know how anyone could ask for more in a relationship except that  my husband  is my best friend.   The only real thing I am uncertain about are health issues. If I should die, I am worried that my husband will not be able to bear the grief. He actually is hoping that I die 1st, so I won't have to go through that pain,  but I would would rather suffer than my husband.   Our relationship is solid built on trust and caring. He cares for me and I do the same for him. We are soulmates and friends.  I am also uncertain that  should my health problems get worse, that my husband that he will have the health need to carry us both or on the other hand if I could do it, but I guess we will both die trying.  So once again I am confident that my husband adores me and always has my best interest at heart. So many times in the past, he has sacrificed for me. I am not really sure if it is because we are in love or because we are best friends, maybe it doesn't matter or maybe you need the two elements to make a relationship work. Either way, something is working for us.",126,6,5,5,6,6,6
"In my relationship, I can't honestly think of anything that I am currently uncertain about. My husband and I spend a lot of time discussing things, and are very open when we are unsure or frustrated about something, as we've found over the years that it is best to catch these things early and address them immediately rather than letting them build up. There were definitely things that I have been uncertain about in the past that led to the adoption of this method though, mainly exactly when we would get married, whether or not he was alright me me adamantly not wanting children, me never finding a job I really liked, and various issues around when we had sex and its frequency. However, all those are settled for now, so I really can't come up with a current issue. I am extremely certain of our relationships foundation, that we love each other, and how we think about things. I know how we are going to try to go forward in the future as well. For example, we are planning on moving to another part of our city this year and don't know exactly when or where, but as we've discussed a plan for locating the best apartment for us and how to make sure we've saved enough money and keep each other updated on everything, it feels like a certain thing even though it involves ambiguity because I know what to expect.  I have no doubts about how I can/should behave around my husband or anything like that, and I feel that I know his feelings towards our relationship and general living situation very well. I feel that our future is very secure, while obviously I can't know everything that is going to happen I feel that I know how we will approach it. I don't have any questions about his thoughts or behaviors at the moment, I feel very sure and secure about everything I can think of.",142,6,6,5,6,6,6
"My relationship is serious and loving. We are best friends at the same time. We put our all in our relationship and never let anyone come in between what we have. We give our all and put a hundred percent into our relationship. I am certain that our relationship will last for years to come. I am certain that he loves me and he is certain that I love him back. I am also certain that we belong together. We also have one child together and we live together. We may fuss but we always get through it and last about it at the end. I know that we care about each other because we always got each other back. I have never met anyone as amazing as my boyfriend. He works so hard to keep me happy just like I work so hard to keep him happy. I love our relationship because we cook together, clean together, and we even shower together everyday. I am uncertain about if we will have twenty years in but I do know we will get close enough. Our relationship is strong and amazing at the same time. I love my man and would not trade him for the world. My relationship is amazing but not perfect. I am certain that he will always have a place in my heart and my life also. I love that we have a strong commitment that nothing will be able to tear us apart at the end of the day. Our relationship is so serious that we put down on a house together and pay bills together. I am certain that I am in love with him and that he means the world to me. Our relationship is five years strong with more years to come. I am uncertain of the future but as long as I got him I am happy at the end of the day. This guy melts my heart in so many ways that I can not explain it. I could write a hundred books on how he treats me so amazing and cares for me so much. I love him in I am certain that he is the guy I can call my husband one day in the future. I love that we we have a great connection in that nobody will ever understand the love we have for each other. No one will get that we had a connection from day one and",153,6,5,5,5,6,6
"The relationship that I have with my husband is very sound. There really isn't anything that we cannot discuss between the two of us. We feel completely comfortable in our relationship. I am certain that the two of us were meant to be together. We get along so well. I am certain that we both feel the same way about each other and I strongly believe that these feelings will continue into the future. We have had some rough patches over the last 8 years, but because we were able to work through those tough times, I am certain that the two of us can get through anything as long as we work together. I am certain that we are comfortable in our relationship and that we love each other as much as the other. I am uncertain about where exactly our sex life will go. We like to explore and push the envelope. I am uncertain how this will unfold as we get older and more experienced with each other. I am uncertain how this will affect our lives in the future, as we have discussed, at some point down the road, having a more open relationship. I am uncertain if this will be a really good thing for us or a bad thing, as we haven't experienced it before. I am uncertain how I, myself, will react if the day comes that we decide to do that. I am also uncertain about how my husband will react to this, if it is decided to go ahead and try it.",114,5,5,5,5,6,5.94
In this relationship I feel very certain about the fact that my husband will always be there for me. I also feel very certain that he'll always go out of his way to be good to me and do the right things to make our relationship work. I also do those things for him as our relationship is very strong in our bond with each other. I have no questions about our love or commitment to each other because we both go out of our way for each other to make sure things work the way they should.  I think when it comes to uncertainty in our relationship the only thing I ever really have concern about is if we will ever get bored with each other. After being together nearly 8 years I can understand that that does happen over time. I know people get wondering eyes or desires to be with others. So I do feel uncertain about that at times from both of us because this is the longest relationship I have ever been in with 1 person. I don't let it bother me because I don't think it'll happen but I do have some uncertainty with the idea of this.,11,4.5,4,4,5,6,5.88
"I am very certain in my relationship.  We are married and very committed to each other.  Honestly there are no questions in my mind regaarding our commitment, our feelings, or our future.  We are very open and upfront with each other and I know how he feels and don't doubt it a bit.  We totally trust each other and we talk a lot about that.  So I think that's one of the main reason there is little to no doubt or uncertainty in our relationship.  We keep eeverything honest and open and out on the table so there is no need for uncertainty or questioning things.  This is one thing I really value in my relationship that is special and unique, because honestly there is doubt and uncertainty in a lot of relationships.  I've haad it in many.  So one of the reasons I married my husband is because this is one of the first relationships where we both felt completely certain and iddn't have to live with that doubt and not knowing how the other one felt or what tomorrow might bring for your relationship.  WE both needed that stability in our lives, so this is one of the glues that holds our relationship together and it's very important to both of us.",53,6,6,5,6,6,5.94
"I am certain about this being the right person for me. I was married before my current wife and was very young when we married. My current wife and I have known each other for a very long time -  and it was always non-romantic / appropriate work relationship. Once I divorced we found each other both single and in our mid 30's. Having known here for so long, once we started dating it was clear we were a good fit. Since then I have only grown more certain that this is the person for me, if there was ever going to be one. I am certain that she will support me, love me, take care of me when needed and is very attracted to me. I am certain of how to make her happy and what she enjoys. I am certain that we can discuss issues that come up that we need to talk about and resolve them in an adult fashion. I am certain that I know how to satisfy her in the bedroom. There really isn't much in our relationship that I am uncertain about at this point. I guess you never know what will happen in the future so there is always some uncertainty but in terms of where we stand with each other, I would say I have no uncertainty.",74,6,6,5,6,6,5.75
"The things that are most certain about our relationship is our love for each other and our daughter. I know that we both love each other very much, and that we love our daughter unconditionally. Those things will never change. I am also sure that we both want our relationship to last forever, and that we want to overcome challenges in our relationship together as a team. We both have a goal of creating and supporting a family that we love, and raising kind, smart children together. We have goals for our financial stability as well, always wanting to be able to support our children‚Äôs needs and desires, and helping them to fulfill their goals. The most important thing that I am certain of is that we want our relationship to continue to work and that our feelings of love are very strong.  I am not sure about our goals for the relationship, particularly career goals and how those will change as we‚Äôve been married longer. I am not sure if changes to our careers in the future will affect the stress levels in our relationship or if that may cause issues for us. I‚Äôm also not sure how our relationship will change as we have more children nor how it will change as we continue to move locations due to my husband‚Äôs job. I am uncertain how our feelings will change for each other as we grow older and lose our youth. I am unsure how our relationship will mature as we go through struggles together later in life.",113,4.5,3,4,4,6,5.75
"I am certain that my husband and I love each other very much.  We have spent over 16 years together and are closer than ever.  We have plans to grow old together and finish raising our children as a unit.  I know that he would do anything for our relationship, as exhibited in the past.  Although we both make mistakes, we strive to come back from them and build our bond even stronger.  I am uncertain of the future 10-15 years down the road.  My health isn't the best and my husband's job is high stress.  It worries me to think that something will happen to one of us and leave the other behind.  I don't know how I would move on if something would ever happen to my husband and continue to live day to day life.  The uncertainty of this prospect scares me and makes me cling even tighter to my relationship, which makes me anxious.  We have a goal to retire to the mountains and spend more time together once the children have graduated from school.  We have the same opinion that we would not want to move our children from the same friends they have known their whole lives and we want a solid foundation for them.",41,4,5,5,5,5,5.94
"I am mostly certain about the important aspects of my marriage. We have the same (for the most part) viewpoints on our religion, morals, political stances, and what is acceptable for how married people should behave. We might disagree on some minor things and that's okay, too. In fact, it makes for some very interesting debates when we're just sitting around the house! That isn't to say everything is perfect. He lost his right leg from the knee down three years ago. It has made for some tough times. I have to be much more aware when planning things like shopping-which can get very frustrating at times. There are times when its just simpler to stay home and that gets annoying for him. I wish the world would be more aware of physical disabilities. There are times we both get somewhat snappy with each other over that in particular. It gets old checking before we do something as simple as going out to dinner to be sure the place is wheelchair friendly.  He gets sad when dealing with it at times, but, thankfully he bounces back pretty quick. Other than that, I wouldn't change anything about our life together. We agree on the important things and the little things we always work out.",51,5,4,5,5,5,5.75
"I am certain that me and my partner love each other and are completely devoted to each other. There are times when I worry but that is my nature, I am a worrisome person. I am certain our family will have lots of love and we will continue to enjoy life as much as we can while being on the same page about very important issues. I am certain that we can always come to an understanding about complex problems and issues that may arise in our relationship because we work so well together.   I am uncertain about the future of our family such as how many children we will have or where we will be living in 5 years. We know we want more children but have not really agreed upon an actual number, which is fine as it makes it more exciting to not have a set number in mind. We also are not sure where we will move next as we both like a lot of the same places to live but again are uncertain as to exactly where we want to be. I am also uncertain as to the exact nature of our working relationship as I want to retire early and travel the world with my family whereas my partner wants to settle down and stay local.",70,4.5,3,4,5,5,5.69
"Im certain that she is the woman that God has put in my life to be with untl the day I pass away. Im certain that we both love each other very much and that with each moment that we pass together, our love for each other keep growing.  Im certain that I enjoy being with her and she is the same with me, regardless of what activity we have to do. Im certain that she has my back and support and likewise, for sure she knows my loyalty towards her and her situation. She can count on me to help her out even in the most difficult situations that can arrive. In terms of uncertanty, I think as of now its just making more time to spend with each other. Our relationship is growing naturally and to be honest,  Im enjoying each step that we take together to grow as a unit. Other wise, the only other thing I can think of that's an issue is just trying to find places that we can go to and make the time for it. In short, making time for each other is probably the main issue now Otherwise, its been going great and I thank God everyday for the opportunity to be with her.",45,6,6,5,6,6,5.94
"My relationship status is extremely stable currently. Recently we have had multiple discussions in the past few weeks about the status of our relationship and our respective inputs and outputs. Because of these high stress conversations, we are primarily completely on sync about our expected behaviors and the direction of our relationship. Prior to these conversations we had began to get frustrated with each other because we were not communicating, now that we are, I am extremely certain that we are trending towards officially beginning a family outside of our pets. Some of the things I am uncertain about in our relationship are around schedules and making time for ourselves. We have been getting increasingly comfortable with the status quo and I think that has been affecting both of us. Before we moved in 4 years ago we both spent a large amount of time exercising either outside or at the gym, and since we moved in it has become more difficult to find time to be ""selfish"" and prioritize our own wishes. I believe much of the dissent in our relationship results from this and from us putting each other first, and that can actually be counter-productive at times because it feels as though you lost yourself. The only other uncertainty I have about the relationship is she is unable to completely trust and see my point sometimes. At times I feel one way and can convey that to her, but she cannot completely trust that and has to constantly question and never fully commit to whatever I have said.",116,4,4,4,5,6,5.75
"The certain thing about my partner is he will do whatever I wish and will not force me to do anything which is not applicable for me. I am an independent woman lives with my partner happily. We are in love for more than 6 years and got married and gave birth to girl baby 4 years ago. He loves girl child a lot and I am very happy that his wish is fulfilled. He took me outing very often and we were enjoying with our child. He knows what will make me happy and try to fulfill all my wishes. I am trying to identify the uncertain things in the relationship, however still I remember some things happened in life as I want to be independent and wish to live in Paris with my lovable partner and child but he rejected that stating he wish to live with his parents. I have explained many time that his we could take care of his parents but cant live together. This brings some crucial situations in the family life and we were not together for more than 2 years. This is the days I am trying to forget as I haven't have a thought that I could live without him. Again with mutual thoughts we started to live together for the sake of our daughter.",72,5,2,4,4,6,5.69
"My partner and I met while we were both at extremely harmful, pivotal times in our life (I was incredibly lonely and being used by people who were not committed to me, and he was in an incredibly overbearing, emotionally unhealthy and un-supportive long-term relationship). Because of each other, we have both been transformed. I am now surrounded by love, support, togetherness, and have someone to achieve goals with and make steps towards the future. He now has someone who stands by him and encourages him to grow. I am certain that we can both be ourselves, that no one has ever meant more to me, that he trusts me, that I have been the most supportive partner he's ever known. I am certain that we both have similar values IN the relationship (trust, honesty, loyalty). We both prefer monogamous relationships. I am certain that we have a future together, that we can work together as a team. Last year, we lost a child together, our daughter (my second loss, his first), and that has done incredible damage to us. Grief is an ugly life transformation and only because we are not the same as individuals, we have struggled. Grief causes depression, our depression has made us more emotional/touchy, more angry, more disconnected, and struggling to keep up with various stressors. In those struggles, situations have arose that inspired things to cause some uncertainty. For example, I am uncertain AT TIMES if he is truly happy with me (anymore), uncertain if we can get ourselves ""back"" to one another, uncertain that we won't always have this different hue to our bond. I am uncertain that our sex life is adequate, because I do not feel that it is. I am uncertain that he is as motivated as I am to peruse certain goals together (ie. first time home buyer's program). We talk about it, but he never makes any initiative to doing the saving, scheduling the meeting, etc. That is only one example. What I am certain of, is that some true, undoubting love is there and so far we have been able",149,3.5,3,4,4,6,5.56
"For the most part, my wife and I are on the same page with regards to what we want in our relationship.  We are a true team when it comes to raising our kids, maintaining our house and trying to reach our financial goals, and when we're lacking in those areas, we each want the other to be honest (while tactful) in pointing out the other's faults in a constructive way.  We enjoy spending time together with various activities or just relaxing and talking, while leaving each other just enough time with solo activities that help fulfill us.  We both have the ultimate goal of simply retiring comfortably and spending much of our days together.  We have very simple needs in that regard and are very similar.  Where we might differ is in the relative priorities of our goals.  Intimacy frequently takes a back seat to earning money at this point, as we're trying to get out of debt and that's priority number one for me, and basically as long as we have sex once or twice a week that's enough.  My wife isn't as happy with that and it becomes a bone of contention sometimes, although it's not something we actively ""fight"" over, it's just that we struggle to balance our priorities.  She understands that not covering our bills for the month stresses me out the most and will not be good for our sex life anyway.",93,3.5,5,4,4,5,5.56
There are many things that I am certain about in my relationship.  I am certain that at this time for sure we both want and expect this relationship to last forever.  We actually had plans to get married a few months ago but were not able to due to financial reason so I am sure we both want to be together forever.  On the other hand there are times that we have gotten into rather bad arguments when we have almost ended the relationship so I can not say that there is no chance that we will break up and that is one uncertainty that worries me the most. I know that we have quite a hard time when it comes to talking about things in our relationship that we do not agree with.  We both tend to just let it build up and build up until one of us explodes on the other.  I am certain though that we can eventually managed to work it out no matter how long it works.  I know that this is something that we need to work on but we are both the type of people who would rather not talk about issues like this because when it is good it is good so why talk about the bad times,57,3,3,4,4,5,5.44
"It's a love marriage so I am very well aware of her thoughts and feelings regarding marriage and future plans. So it is certain that I could make her happy always. She likes to go for outing very often and I take her to different places. Only because I know well about her, I could make her certainly happy. She is a best mother that I like the most, she will segregate what is necessary and what is unnecessary for the children and do that. As she is child lover it is certain that she will show the children with perfect carrier path. I have already told her before marriage that my parents is very important for me and I do not have any wish to come out of my parents after marriage and she agreed and even still we are living with our parents, that makes to me to feel very special. I am thinking what is the uncertain about our relationship is she doesn't like to cook. But I am a food lover, I wish her to prepare different dishes and have some interest on cooking however as she doesn't like to stand in kitchen with stuffy environment I don't want to force her to make different variety of dishes for me. Even though I understand her very well sometimes what is in my mind will come out and even I felt sorry for that.",90,5.5,6,3,4,6,5.31
"Here's the thing about  my relationships with my partner: MYSELF: DINESH ADITHYAA PARTNER:SARANYA  Sometimes we're candlelit date nights, and walks through grassy meadows, and feeding each other cake at our wedding.  But sometimes we're doing the dishes, and comforting a screaming baby, and fighting over whose turn it is to do the dishes or comfort the screaming baby.  Which is to say, while sometimes my love and passion for each other is obvious, sometimes it's really, really not.  Psychologists have spent years studying the traits that are fundamental to successful long-term relationships and come up with a few key ideas. We rounded up some of their most surprising insights below.   If I notice that our relationship doesn't meet all these criteria, that does not necessarily mean I should end things with my partner. Consider this list a general set of guidelines that can help you start evaluating whether your current relationship is bringing you satisfaction and happiness. There‚Äôs nothing more nerve-racking and stressful than having uncertainty in our relationship. When i uncertain of my partner, it can feel like a roller coaster of emotions and doubts, but it doesn‚Äôt have to last.  Like most of the blocks we face in our life and relationships, uncertainty comes from fear ‚Äî the fear of loss and heartbreak, the fear of losing our independence and, most common of all, the fear of the unknown.  We often fuel that uncertainty by trying to protect ourselves from that fear by pulling away, looking for reasons to justify it and maybe even cutting our losses all together and breaking up with someone before they hurt us.",121,3.5,3,3,4,5,5.06
"I am certain about the relationship status, because we both agreed we're in the dating phase but it's still not serious enough to, for example, introduce him to my parents. I'm also certain we both want this to work, so we're putting lots of effort on it. I'm also sure that communication isn't hard in this relationship, because we've discussed plenty of difficult / serious topics and talked about that in a mature manner, respectfully and in a calmed way. I'm also certain this might develop into a serious and healthy relationship because so far, everything has been healthy, respectful and good, so that makes me feel good about myself and the relationship I'm into. I'm also certain we're n the same page regarding marriage and kids, we both want it at some point, but not in the short term, so that's a good thing (And I'm not sure that will happen in this relationship, but at least we're on the same page.  I am uncertain about how long this will last, but I think that happens with every relationship so it's not a big deal to me. I'm also uncertain about his long term plans, I don't know if he plans to stay in this city for so long, and how that might interfere with the relationship at that point. Sometimes I'm afraid to ask about that.",79,2.5,4,4,4,6,5.13
"I am certain that our relation is working well as far as we know , there are arguments from time to time but what relationship does not have ?  All in all we are very happy together and we try to do the best to make each other happy , my wife is everything i ever wanted and i am happy the way we evolve through time. What i am uncertain of is how long will this happiness last , because  there are many factors to think about , diseases , deaths , and many other types of unhappy situations , but hopefully me and her will keep being happy for a long time. But as i said relationships have good times and bad times and there are arguments which are hard to avoid , for example work related , or discussions about having kids or not yet , on one side we need to save money first and have our own house  paid , then to build a family , no relation is perfect that is for sure but we sure do try to make it as easy and pleasant for each other, for example even if there are mild annoyances i try to keep my calm and not explode my anger on her. But in the end only time will tell i believe.",40,3.5,3,4,5,5,4.06

"Things that I am certain about is the love that we have for one another. I certain of that because it is displayed every day. There is no way that two people would have and continue to go through on a daily basis if they did not love one another. I am also certain about our goals. We both love our children. There is no doubt that they are the loves of our lives in addition to loving one another. Our children do everything with us. We make sure that life is good for them and engaging with high quality stimuli for both their minds and bodies. If I move on to things I am uncertain of, the first thing that would come up is the length of this relationship. It is not because either of us want to go and be with anyone else or just not be together, it is because there is a significant age difference between my husband and me. He is much older, and we get concerned with the fact that him passing long before me is a great deal of uncertain thoughts. There is not anything other than that that I am uncertain about in regards to this relationship. I mean, things like where we may be living in a few years (what part of the world), or what we may be doing for money may change, but that does not cause any type of conversation when we speak if things that we are uncertain of.",109,4,3,3,5,6,2.63
"My partner and I have a very good relationship. We have what I would describe as a mutual give and take relationship. We know where each other stands on all issues. That is not to say that we do not have our differences, but we respect each others different opinions on certain matters. I am certain that I can count on my partner in any manner and she can count on me. We are there to support each other through both the good and bad times. We discuss how money will be spent for the household, while still maintaining our own separate accounts. We have a house budget and agree on any major purchase and equally split the costs. I do not have many uncertainties in this relationship. I know that whatever comes along, my partner will be there and act in a fashion that is in keeping with her character. The only uncertainty would be what she would do if I would pass before her. I would expect that she would be able to adequately deal with any circumstances that arise as she is very capable. I am happy with this relationship as is my partner. We both benefit mutually and have a deep caring and love for each other.",36,6,6,4,6,6,6
"We have been together nearly five years with relatively minimal trouble or conflict, so the majority of the status of my relationship errs heavily on the side of certainty. I am extraordinarily certain about our commitment to each other, the way we feel about one another [both good and bad], as well as the fact that we love each other deeply. I am also certain that we both have the same goals for our relationship over the long term, and that we both want to be together for the long haul. I also have no doubt about our sex life: It's great, and we both have reasonably similar appetites in that realm. We are also both certain about the fact that we trust each other implicitly, and that we both make an effort to withhold judgement toward one another even under trying circumstances. Overall, I think we are both pretty certain about the overwhelming majority of, at least most of the, crucial dynamics involved in our relationship. That noted, I think the majority of uncertainty probably stems from the differences we have. Chief among these would be where we ultimately want to live -- he emphatically wants to relocate, whereas I really do not as I like being near my family. I honestly have no idea how that will play out in the longer term. Another area of uncertainty, for me at least -- albeit slightly mundane -- is how much I can tolerate being the only one [in general, at least] who does the majority of the work around the house all the time with little to no help. It's infuriating at times, particularly considering that I don't have any more or less free time than he does to begin with. There is also some uncertainty, again, for me, with how I deal with my partner's choice to spend such an absolutely inordinate amount of time with his close group of friends. It's been the source of conflict between us more than once -- not least because I just simply don't think they are terribly great people -- and I'm never terribly sure when to say something for my own emotional heal",150,4,5,6,5,6,6
"I have been with my Husband for 23 years, I have zero doubt about our relationship. We have amazing communication skills and we take time out for each other every day. Our relationship is easy compared to most, we are best friends and we WANT to spend a lot of time together. We text each other all day just to ask how we are doing, no topic is off limits. I can talk to him about anything. Our sex life is still very active, we are passionate and attracted to each other. We still hold hands while walking in the mall or what ever. We have two children together and a child from a previous marriage. We have a very relaxed attitude. I never worry that he is cheating on me, we are home together every night. We do everything together, shopping, walking the dogs, cooking dinner etc. I cannot imagine my life with out him, he is the 1st person I go to when I have good or bad news, or just want to talk to someone. He supports me and I support him in his dreams and aspirations. Everyone says we are perfect together because they can see even after all these years how much we love and respect each other",47,6,6,5,6,6,5.56
"We are very certain about our lives and our relationship status.  We met back when we were junior's in high school, which was almost 20 years ago now.  We dated pretty solidly for 2 years, then broke up for a little while before getting back together.  We got married when we were 24, and now have 3 awesome daughter's.   We are certain in our relationship.  Our relationship is based on our God, and his strength between us keeps us strong in each other.  It's not like we don't have the typical problems or arguments, sometimes over the stupidest of things, but we always know that we will love one another, love our family, and nothing will stop us from being together forever, because that is the vow that we made to each other, and to God, over 10 years ago now.   One thing that usually is a contention though is how and where we spend our free time.  Usually we spent it together, but if we split off too much, my wife seems to not like that very much so I tend not to do so as often as I may like.   In the end though, we'll always be together.  I don't see anything that would break that bond between us, I am certain of that.  We have been through a lot together already, and although tough, it has made us stronger together in the end.",89,6,5,5,6,6,5.75
"My husband and I have a lot of things that we are certain about in our relationship. Over the years we have figured out how to approach each other about issues we may be having and how to treat the other person. We both have the same set of values and both have the same outlook on life. We share a common sense of humor and we can cheer each other up no matter how upset the other one is. We both enjoy a lot of the same activities and hobbies and spend time together doing them. In terms of what we are uncertain about is what external pressures will impact our relationship. I have been looking for a new job and that has added stress to the relationship since we are not certain where I am going to end up. We have had issues in the past and I have some concern they may arise again but can‚Äôt be truly sure if they will or won‚Äôt. For the most part though, we have been together long enough to work through most of our issues and work pretty much from the same playbook. I can predict how my husband will react to most situations and he can do the same for me. That is what 23 years together does for a relationship.",69,3.5,5,4,5,6,5.31
"I'm certain that we both like spending time together, that we both want to get more healthy and improve things like our spaces.  And that together we like making these decisions and steps.  I'm also certain we're both content, and don't get sick of each other.  We like spending a full day together during the weekend, and want to see each other during the week as well.  We both like saving money, and so doing things more cheaply is something we're interested in.  I'm secure that he finds me attractive, and has no issues with my weight or appearance, or even how I dress.  We accept each other for who we are.  On the other hand, it's a little uncertain what we both want from the relationship.  We're content, and plan to be together for the foreseeable future, but it's unclear who might want to get married, and whether kids might be a discussion.  I'm not even sure if I want kids.  He's older by 13 years and I have a rocky past that means I'm not as far along in my life or career as I want to be, my life is in flux.  So it's uncertain whether he's going to get frustrated with this, or if I'll be able to advance fast enough to make him feel like it's a real partnership, and whether moving in together and committing fully is something that we'd be able to make work.  It's also a little uncertain if we're together because it's easy, or because we're the best fit.",111,2,4,4,4,6,5.19
"My relationship is currently rocky. My boyfriend doesn't seem to understand my needs and instead, only takes care of his own needs. I don't like that. It makes me feel bad. I love him so much, but I am not certain about it. I feel like it's not going to work out in the long run. He's mean to me at times, and screams at me for no reason. I always feel like I'm not good enough. However, at times we have wonderful days.  For example, we take a lot of trips together, and I've experienced a lot of things with him. We have traveled the world, with so many happy and fun memories. We make each other feel good during those moments, and at those points, I feel like things are certain between us. But once things go back to the way they were, I feel sad again. I start to feel like those happy times don't outweigh the bad times.  My goals for the future would be to go to therapy together and work things out with one another. I would like for us to live happily ever after, but there is going to be a lot that needs to happen before we get there. I would like for us to work together for a common goal on how to make each other happy. It should not just be all about me making him happy or taking care of his needs, but he also needs to learn how to take care of mine as well. It's not an easy thing, and it hurts me a lot.",119,1.5,3,3,3,5,5
"I'm in a married relationship. I'm certain that our current and foremost issue is money. I'm a University dropout who earns little money by freelancing. My wife was working in a Multi national company but currently she is a full time mom taking care of our 1 year old son. I struggle a lot to make money for our everyday expenses and so we are living with my parents (Both my mom and dad are employed). We depend on my parents financially and my wife is very uncomfortable about it. I know this but couldn't help.  To talk about uncertain issues. We were dating since high school and broke up for 2 years primarily because of fights arising out of my employment issues. Then we re-united and married. Still now I have doubt that my wife might get a divorce from me because of my financial status. Together we don't have any savings, assets or jewellery. To be short we are penniless and we are very scared of school fees in our country which is a huge amount (almost my 3 months salary) and uncertain about how we are gonna send our son for schooling. Everyday we have silly fights over financial issues and I'm afraid anytime it would grow monstrous breaking our marriage bond.",55,1.5,3,4,3,6,4.19
"I'm certain about how much my husband loves me and is committed to me in our relationship. I can tell my husband loves me because he always did and does a lot for us. He saved me when we first got together because I was not having good luck in dating and I was terribly sad all the time. He changed that by being there for me, always following through, and doing manly things that take commitment to get done. For example, he fixed the plumbing in our house, which required him to get into cramped, uncomfortable positions. He also does all the dirty work so that I don't have to be uncomfortable. He never goes out with friends or anything. He is always with me, and I love that. I am uncertain about how much sex had to do with why my husband married me. I am also uncertain in how he compares me to other relationships from his past. Our sex life is important to us but we were intimate early on, and I think this is why he got hooked onto me. He never discusses past relationships so I can't gauge how he feels about them. That is probably a good thing, though.",22,3.5,4,4,5,6,5.81
"In my relationship I am certain of the following items. I am certain that my partner feels them same about me as I feel about her. I am also certain that we have the same religious beliefs that make a foundation for our relationship with each other and our families. Another certainty I have is how we feel about our future together. I have two children from a previous marriage and she has none. She is great with the kids and both of us agree that we would love to have more kids together. We are both certain of our career goals and how they match up with our family structure. Both of us strongly believe that our jobs and careers are important, but making time for our family is of the utmost importance to us.  There are a couple minor things that I am not certain of as this moment. My fianc√© and I both love to fly fish and right now it is a big part of our lives. Escaping to the mountains and spending the weekend fishing in trout streams is a favorite to both of us. I'm not sure that when we add to our family and have new babies if that will continue with both of us or if that time and hobby will be a thing of the past that will be replaced by additional time with small children. We also have a fifteen year age gap between us where I am the older of us. I am not certain later on when I age how she will continue to feel about me romantically. With that age gap down the road things could chance between us and how we view each other.",129,3.5,5,4,5,6,5.81
"I'am certain about our feelings toward each other during these times, we are pretty confident in ourselves we just want the same goals and want the same things in life. For the most part we are on par with what we want with our goals. We both try to save our money for the future and try to do things to better our relationship. I'm just not sure about my partner because she likes to live in the now and the not the future. She likes to spend her money on expensive things in life and not really worry about the future sometimes and gets carried away with that kind of life which makes me feel uncertain. Sometimes it's hard to get her to look at the bigger picture in life and really notice what is important in life and material things don't and shouldn't matter much. She is starting to get it now so its becoming a bit better for our relationship and the mental health of our relationship. We want to buy a house and know that we have to save and really cant waste a dollar on anything that's not worth it. Slowly but surely we will get where we need to be.",20,2.5,4,4,4,5,5.38
"In my relationship there are many things that I am certain about along with a few that I am not as certain about. As far as the big picture goes and where our relationship is going, I believe that we are both on the same page. We are interested in moving forward and taking the next steps when appropriate. Our feelings are also something that I am certain about. I know how we both feel about each other. The things that we want in life are similar as well. After being together for this amount of time, I know that we are both growing together in similar ways. We enjoy each other's company and like to do things together. Things that I'm not as certain about tend to be the smaller things in the relationship like things that she likes and dislikes when I give her a gift. She is always so thankful that sometimes I don't know if she is being totally honest or just telling me what she thinks that I want to hear. Another thing I am uncertain about is her timetable. I know that our relationship is moving forward in a good way, but sometimes I think it's not moving fast enough for her.",33,4,4.5,5,4,5,4.94
"I am very certain about how my partner and I feel about each other. We really sincerely care about each other and do what we can to make each other happy. We give up our goals for each other and we do whatever we can to make sure that we each have a good day. We each want to help each other achieve our goals and we do whatever we can do to make that happen. At the same time, we have uncertainties in our relationship just like everyone else. Right now the biggest issue is money and where our relationship is going to go. We are married and we have no plans to divorce and our relationship is strong but he wants children and I don't. I don't know if this is something that I will change my mind on but he said that he'll wait and work through it together. So it's very uncertain for me to try to figure out whether or not we will ever have children, especially with our money issues. One thing that is for certain, though, is that we have plans to figure it out together and so I am not too concerned. I really love my partner and I am certain that we still stay together in the future. We are both extremely loyal people and we have both invested a lot in this relationship that we would lose if this marriage came to an end, so I don't think that we will ever divorce, but having kids is a big uncertainty. Overall, I am certain that our relationship is stable and we will be able to work through any problem we have because our relationship really is close to my ideal and I love him very much.",132,3.5,5,5,5,5,5.56
We've been together for 18 months. I'm certain of many things. We are best friends. We dont do battle. Its not that sort of relationship. We have each others backs. Im  certain she loves me and I am certain I love her. Our relationship keeps moving forward. I am uncertain if we are going to be married someday. Only because neither of us seem to want it very much. We're content.  We are committed to our shared goals. One goal is wealth building and not being stupid with our money as we both were in the past. Im certain we dont want any kids(she has two). I feel like we are very open with each other. I know her mind. Her worries and what makes her laugh.  Im certain of our relationships with each others families and friends. Her friends are now my friends and vice versa. Im certain things are going very well now. Probably because we take care of our money situation and have no small kids-both of which add a lot of stress to a relationship.  Im certain I am in a loving relationship where we take care of one another emotionally and sexually and we communicate well also.,15,5.5,4,4,5,6,5.5
"We have been together fun some time now.  We have a pretty good understanding of each other. We are at the point that we know each others tendencies and moods. I know there are times when we will be talkative and there are times when we don't say much. I am certain about how to approach my partner and what tone to use. I know that being aggressive will cause her to be offended or pull back from the conversation. I am certain about what she likes and what she doesn't like as far as presents and the types of movies she likes. And they usually different from the ones I like. There are times when she is in certain moods and I don't know why. I can tell that the smallest thing frustrates her. I will ask a question and she has a short reply. Or I will have to ask twice to get a response. I will usually just leave her alone and give her space. Sometimes this doesn't work and we get into a disagreement about why I'm not talking to her. This rarely happens but when it does, I feel like I'm in a no win situation. I'm certain that our relationship will endure any setback. I know we don't have a perfect relationship but I think it's natural for people to have differences in opinion. I'm not certain about her different moods but I've become pretty good at dealing with them over time. The stress and demands of work usually plays a role in mood.  There are many times we have disagreements because we know each other well. And we accept each other for who we are.  But there are times when we have to work harder and being respectful and understanding of one another.",134,4,5,5,4,5,6
"We have been together a long time almost 22 years. There are a few things that I am certain about. First it's our commitment to each other. We can count on each other to be there when we need reassurance or affirmation about how thing our going in life. I am certain We won't cheat on each other. This has become stronger the longer we have been together. Now going on 20 years We really have are not looking to stray. This does take some work I always tell my partner how great they look and take an interest in their work and interests. But I am certain we will stay dedicated to each other. Sure you see other attractive people and some show interest in you. But to throw away what we have at this point is not worth it. There are a few uncertain things though. What will happen as we get older and our health fails. Will we be able to cope with the stress of aging. Will we be able to take care of each other. What will happen as we can not longer work, will we have enough money to retire and live as we do now. But overall in our relationship I am much more certain about things than uncertain. I think this is due to being together for a long time and understanding each other.",85,4,5,5,5,6,5.56
"I am certain about most things in our relationship as it currently stands. Overall, our relationship is very strong and stable. I know that we are both happy and satisfied with our current relationship, and with each other. We are sure of how strong our relationship is, and how to act toward each other. We know the boundaries of our relationship, and we know each others' strengths and weaknesses. We know that we make a good team and intend to remain together for the foreseeable future. I know that we both feel content and want to remain in a relationship for the long term. I know that I feel strongly toward my partner and love her, and I know that she feels the same way toward me. I have no uncertainty about our commitment and love toward each other. I am slightly unsure about a few things when it comes to the long term future of our relationship. We have not really discussed getting married or having children. I am not particularly fond of either, especially having children, and I am a bit unsure if my partner wants to have children some day. I assume it is likely that we will get married at some point, but I am in no rush to do so, and we just haven't really discussed it, so I am unsure about if and when that will happen. My partner has said she also does not necessarily want children, but I think it is possible she might change her mind, and I wonder if I will ever change my mind about it too. I am also a bit unsure of our long term goals regarding where we will live and how our two careers will fit together, especially if one requires moving. This could create some conflict and hard decisions about what to do. Overall, my uncertainties are mostly about some parts of the relationship like marriage, children, and location, but the underlying fundamental nature of our relationship is strong and I feel very certain about it.",143,3.5,4,3,5,6,5.56

"Trust is the cornerstone of any healthy partnership. With it, your relationship can thrive and withstand even the biggest challenges. Without it, you'll be ill-equipped to take on the really tough stuff.  Me and my partner have similar goals that would take you to similar places, that is a big factor in determining certainty in our relationship. we regularly appreciate our good things. we have similiar goals in life that makes us to unite together forever we are always in intimate relationship. when it comes to mistakes i may apologize to her to make her happy. we are like close friends in difficult situations. that makes me certain about our relationship my partner always loves me when she got angry these are the positives of my relationships with her. we are always have a healthy competition. we sometimes feels annoyed that makes our relationship uncertain. sometimes we have jealousy over others about our earnings and social status that makes me feel that our relationship uncertain. sometimes we have intimacy issues that make us to feel that our relationship is susceptible to break-up. sometimes our past seems to be a problem in our current situation. however overall i thought that she is very beautiful and caretaking. and i hope that our relationship will last forever. i pray god daily",64,3.5,4,3,4,5,4.81
"There are some things that I am unsure about in my relationship one of those things are if he is with me to be with me or if he knows that I need him right now and that‚Äôs why he is with me. Sometimes I know that he loves me based on how he acts but sometimes he does nothing and im not sure. He knows that right now I do not make enough money on my own to support our two children, he also knows that I am in school full time and without him helping to pay for the school than I would not be able to go. But I always think if he wanted to leave me I don‚Äôt think he would until I finish school so I wouldn‚Äôt be struggling with our kids. The one thing that i am certain in our relationship is that he enjoys having sex with me. He always wants to have sex and always talks about how good it is and what I did great in the interaction. So, I know for sure that he is satisfied with our sex life and I have no doubt it because of his actions.",1,2.5,3,4,3,4,4.38
"My relationship with my girlfriend is pretty mature I would say, she understands my needs and I always support in her no matter what the circumstances are. There is certainly a mutual love and respect between both of us. We value each other's presence and say to each how much this relationship means to us. We are certainly satisfied with our relationship at this moment, we understand that we have different career goals that we must pursue and one shouldn't come across each other's career in any way. We understand the need of space every now and then, that's if one of us is angry or feels like its better to be alone for few days we are mature enough to allow this in our relationship. What's uncertain in our relationship is our future, whether we will marry or not is something we are still trying to figure out. The problem lies in our families and that makes us really anxious and upset at times and sometimes becomes the reason for a fight between us. My point of view is that we should continue our relationship and pursue our life goals before settling in for a marriage but she wants it to happen now as she's being really anxious regarding my take on marriage. I, on the other hand, don't want to rush anything and would like to take my time to secure my future first before deciding something as monumental as marriage.",98,4,3,2,4,4,4.5

I am certain that my husband loves me and we are very open about what is going on in our lives. I have been married before this and this is the best relationship I have ever had. My husband and I lean on each other when needed and make sure that we are satisfied with how our life is going. I never have any doubts about if my husband is wanting to someone else or thinking about being with someone else. We both support each other in our life choices. The only thing I can say I am uncertain about is if we are going to live long lives. I know we will be together to our dying day and be holding hands when we take our last breathe whether it be me or him that goes first. I know that my husband is always going to be there when I need him no matter what. When I first my husband I knew he was the one that would be there for the rest of my life. We talk about everything including what annoys us and what we want to change to make our relationship better. We work everyday to ensure that we are still happy and satisfied with our lives and what is happening.,54,6,6,5,6,6,6
"My husband and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary in September, but we were dating for one year before that so we've been together 31 years.  We have gone through so much together, good and bad, and we have gone through many trials together.  One thing I am certain about in this relationship is that we will be together for the rest of our lives.  If we have been able to weather some of the trials we had when we were younger, including a bout of infidelity, than I can't imagine anything else that would keep us apart.  One thing I am uncertain about in our relationship is our capacity to weather illness events.  I have seen my aunt and uncle's marriage just fall apart because he suffered a stroke and his personality changed to the point that she could no longer stay with him.  It is a sad reality that, sometimes, mental illness can be that deal breaker where one person in the relationship decides it just isn't worth abandoning their happiness to stay in the relationship.  So, my uncertainty is with something like this happening where one of our personality shifts to a point that the other can no longer deal with being near that person.  I truly hope that never happens!  But, I have seen it happen before.",66,3.5,5,5,5,6,6
"My husband and I have been together for nearly 17 years and so there are many things that I am certain about in this relationship.  I feel like I am an ""expert"" when it comes to our relationship.  I know that he will always be here for me when I need him, regardless of whether we are getting along at that moment or not.  If I need him he is there, no questions.  He is very reliable in that sense and he also knows that the same goes in a reversed situation.  I am always there for him.  We are always able to count on each other in tough times for support.  I know that our relationship is very stable as far as staying together.  We are both aware that it would take an extreme event for us to part ways.  We have both made it clear to each other that we are not going anywhere.  I am certain that there will always be certain things we argue about and that we are able to effectively deal with those minor disagreements and move on from them without them negatively affecting our relationship.  The things about my relationship that are uncertain are mainly how we will be with each other once the kids are older and move out.  Right now the majority of our time in a relationship together has been with children in the picture and things will be quite different when they are all out of the house.  I wonder how we will fill the time together.  We will be alone together a lot more and that is something we aren't used to and sometimes I worry that we will run out of things to do or to talk about.",131,3.5,5,4,5,5,6
"After nine years of dating and a couple of years of marriage, most aspects of our relationship have settled towards certain.  Overall, we know that we will sustain our relationship for as long as we are both alive.  We also know that we will never make moves towards another lover.  Overt time, we have also realized that we share a strikingly similar sense of humor.  This has been the foundation for our approach towards life.  We enjoy similar activities due to our shared humor.  We use humor to deflect negative developments from our back.  And we pass these philosophies on to our children, and pray that they will share the certain qualities that my wife and I share.   On the other side of the token, there are always uncertainties in relationships including our relationship.  No human could know everything about another lover, so there is no stress in realizing that uncertainties exist.  Continuing along the humor path, there are occasions where I'm not sure whether my wife will find the ensuing joke or prank as funny as I do.  Diving into a more serious topic, I hope that I have a solid understanding of my wife's religious beliefs, but alas I am not inside her head.  So in summation, there are bits of knowledge large and small, that we may not be certain about and that's ok.",80,5.5,6,4,5,5,5.75
"Some times I worry about not being enough. I am a registered sonographer but I am also a mother of 4 being pulled in work life and home life and sometimes not everything is done. Some times I don't want to be be touched, sometimes after a rough day that's all I want. I know this is a romantic relationship but I worry that I am not enough or I don't do enough.  I am certain he loves me  and I am certain he loves our kids.  I am certain that he will always be there for them but I m uncertain about his health and if it will be enough to keep him here long enough to see them graduate. i  am certain that he enjoys our sex life but I am uncertain if he wants it as much as I do. I am certain we are done having kids and is I am certain he is  done as well.  I am uncertain that this relationship was made because we got pregnant or if we truly loved each other at the time but as time grew we fell in love with each other  and have had 2 more kids ( our first pregnancy was twins).",18,4,3,4,4,6,5.63
Things I am certain of in our relationship: That he loves me. That he is always there for me. We will stay together for the next 5-10 years. We are both committed to our relationship. That are relationship is stable. We have the same outlook on life. That we have the same goals for our future. We would not betray each other's trust. That we are both committed to the children we have had together.  Things I am uncertain about in our relationship: If he really does find me attractive or if he likes me because he is comfortable with me and we have been together so long. Does he wish that we had not gotten married so young and he could have lived more bachelor life. Does he really like that I am a stay at home mom? Will we be together for the rest of our lives? Does he really notice and appreciate how much I do? Will he take better care of his health as we grow older? How he really views his family's issues with me. How much he just agrees with me versus how much he believes the same things I do. (Is it just easier to agree rather than think of thing on his own),42,2.5,4,4,4,6,5.63
In my current relationship I am certain about a few things. I am certain about trust and loyalty. Between the both of us we do not have to worry about each other because of the mutual respect. We are also certain that we are both contributing to the relationship to make things work out instead of leaving problems out in the open. Another certain aspect of our relationship is our duty to religion and individual progression. We are both religious so we do have to prioritize that first in our lives. What I mean by individual progression is we leave space and time for each other to do our own things instead of constantly trying to dictate each others lives.  Some things I am uncertain about is when we will move into an apartment together and when it will be the right time to settle down. We are also uncertain about the idea of kids given the current economy and hardships that the young face nowadays. The uncertain things in our relationships are a good thing though. These are things that we constantly work on while we're together. It's all about living and learning. There is no such thing as a perfect relationship. We are just taking it day by day working on ourselves and our relationship.,58,5,4,4,5,6,5.5
"With this relationship I know that I am certain that neither one of us wants to lose the other. We have been through a lot and have finally learned how to communicate or needs and dislikes with each other with out it being taken the wrong way. Also I am certain that we have grown stronger as friends because we have started communicating more. .Now the only uncertainty I have with this relationship is how long it will be before we get married or even if that will ever happen. The fact that we have been together for 12 years and have 3 kids you would think that marriage would be the next step. But on the flip side of the 12 years there has been a lot of infidelity, lies, and just a lot of trust issues. I feel that we have finally found our happy place but I do not want to rush into something just to please everyone else I would like to continue to take things slow so that we can keep learning each other. Hopefully one day there will be a wedding in the future but as of right now I am enjoying just connecting with the person he has transformed into.",28,3.5,5,4,4,5,5.56
"There are several things I am sure about in my relationship with my spouse. I know that we are committed to being together, and that we support each other in whatever we try to do - we are each others cheerleaders, we both know we have each other's back. I am sure about how we perform our relationship in a practical sense - keeping house and what not. I am fairly certain about our future goals and how we like to use our leisure time/time together, to satisfy both our needs. I have a pretty good idea of the things we need to compromise on, and I trust that we are able to do so. I am uncertain about some things related to our sexual relationship, and how compatible we are in that regard. I have fairly particular needs and desires in a committed sexual relationship, and getting my partner on board with that has been somewhat of a struggle, so that causes some uncertainty as to whether or not we will both fully satisfy each others needs in the long run. I am certain, however, of both of our desires and abilities in addressing and dealing with our uncertainties, so that helps to manage the uncertainty.",21,5,4,4,5,6,5.44
"I am certain that my partner and I have the same basic goals in life (marriage, owning a home, having no children) and are on the same page in terms of achieving them. I also am completely certain that we feel the same way about each other and share a profound mutual respect and love. We also agree on the terms of our relationship and while we have very few ""rules"" in a traditional sense, as we have an open relationship, we do make a point to make sure that the other person always feels loved and valued. Overall, this feels like a very stable and lasting long-term relationship and I feel happy to be a part of it. I expect it to be successful for years to come and much look forward to spending the rest of my life with my partner. I feel very strongly committed to this relationship and I have no doubt whatsoever that my partner does as well, especially as we are on track to get married next year.  On the other hand, I am not certain about how we will change throughout the years; it's possible that we may become two very different people in a couple of years and will have to continually find new ways to connect and learn about one another. We also have very different social habits, which have created conflict in the past; my partner prefers to spend a lot of time with me and his friends, while I prefer to spend time either with just friends or with him. This is something we will likely have to continue examining throughout the course of our relationship.",124,5.5,5,3,5,6,5.63
"There is quite a bit I am certain of. We still have strong romantic attraction after several years being together. We share many of the same laughs and cries, we have very similar tastes. On things we differ about we seem to have a strong sense of respect for the others opinion and know what to 'tip toe' around. but overall I feel like I found both a best friend and a partner. Our lives are intertwined now including our families so we certainly became part of each others lives.  On the uncertainty side its all the normal stuff.. Just some odds and ends.. for example she is career oriented, and I am not.. This sometimes is a cause of  uncertainty especially when looking at our future. I am getting older as is she, so sometimes we also talk about children which is a bit of a sore spot. I want the relationship to last and wouldnt mind getting married but she is not interested in this and would prefer to plan living together till we get old and grey.  but overall just minor uncertainty and sometimes as silly as 'what movie do we watch tonight?'  or of course the food we eat- we both seem to like different kinds of food. but on a more serious issue, I do believe I am more attached to her then she is me and that is our biggest uncertainty unfortunately.",91,4,4,5,4,5,5.13
"Our relationship is very comfortable. We are clear on what we stand for and what we want for the future. It‚Äôs also fair to say we are just as clear on what we don‚Äôt want. We are very in tune, rarely have arguments and really support each other on a deep level.  What we agree on is that we know what bases are relationship. For instance, ethics, mutual respect, intimacy, love of family, travel, religion,  and personal growth are important to both of us. We give each other space we need to grow in these areas, and as a person. We believe that life is worth experiencing and each day should be considered a gift and live to the fullest. In addition two supporting family strongly, we believe it's our job to be good stewards and citizens of the world. This means better focus on environmental issues and  easing human suffering is at the forefront of our beliefs  and values. We focus on these areas because at this point in our relationship and our lives we believe it's the right thing to do.  What we also agree on is what we don't want our relationship to be. We don't want to be distant from each other or other people in our community or the greater world. our focus is and has always been on learning about the world and understanding both our relationships place in it as well as our own as individuals.  The above is what we are certain on.  We really don't have uncertainties at all. We are committed to our relationship as well as individual growth. If ever we have doubts or uncertainties, we discuss them right way.",127,6,6,4,6,6,5.19
"I am absolutely certain about the love we have for each other and it being genuine. We have been through a lot and have seen many advertises in our life. We have set a good foundation for our family and that is worth everything. We are great as parents together and both strive for a better future. We understand each other because we come from the same background. We always support each other and are the strongest supports of each other. I am uncertain about when we will actually get married. We have been together for years now, but things are not right financially and that holds him back. I think the hardest part of our relationship is trying to start our careers and balance family life. It gets hard sometimes and that can pull us apart with us being so busy. We had our first kid before we was really in our careers. Us spending less time together one on one can put a strain on it. I've always been certain about our feelings towards each other but the support systems we have beyond each other is little. That concerns me when we cant always see eye to eye. Communications is a big key in our relationship. This is something we always work on also. It always improves though.",63,5,4,4,5,5,5.5
"The beginning of my relationship was an uncomfortable road and a rocky one at that. In the beginning, I was incredibly insecure about my relationship. Granted, some things did happen that would make me feel that way. I didn't know where we stood and if it was something that she even wanted to be apart of. This was also my first time ever being in a long distance situation, which was incredibly new to me. We were working against a lot of odds it felt like, not knowing when we would be able to see each other next. It made everything much more intense and we got even closer than if we weren't long distance. Today, I am incredibly confident and certain in our relationship. We are able to talk about almost everything and we have a decent form of communication. Most of my insecurities around the relationship is that there was no way they would want to be in a situation where we can not see each other. The things today that I am certain about is where we are heading in the future, the things we would like to accomplish together and the plans we are making for our future.",7,6,3,4,5,5,5.44
"I am certain about most things in our relationship. I am certain that my boyfriend loves me very much. He always tells me how much he loves and appreciates me. We have been together for awhile, and I know that he cherishes me. I also know that I love him very much and I appreciate him a great deal. We have been together for awhile, but there are a few things that I am uncertain about. For example, we are getting ready to move in together in a few months. We have always lived separately. I am fiercely independent and introverted, and I'm not sure how I am going to adjust to living with him all the time. Right now I think I will be happy living with him, but I can't say for sure. It's unknown territory for me, so I will have to see how it goes. Hopefully I will be happy living with him and we will have a happy life together. I am also somewhat nervous that being together all of the time will lead to resentment between us. I value my privacy very much and it might be hard to adjust to having another person around all of the time. I'm worried that I will fall out of love with my partner the longer we're ""stuck"" together.",68,5,4,5,4,5,5
"The things I am certain about in my relationship/marriage with my husband is loyalty. We both know what it is like to be cheated on and we both know what it feels like to be loyal. Cheating is not acceptable and knowing that both of us has experienced that trauma, make us more devoted to one another. I am also certain about our life goals. We both want a house and children and we have a financial plan that we are putting into place to make sure those are achievable. We also share morals and values. We are huge fans of respect and make sure that we do for others more than we do for ourselves. We are certain about our faith in God and we both know how we can please him and how we can do for others as well. Some things we are uncertain about is our intimate relationship. We both are very awkward when it comes to this and I don't think we are on the same level. He has had relationships in the past based on intimacy and did not have the emotional connection with his past girlfriends. I had the connection emotionally and physically. I have no problem being intimate with him except for my personal insecurities of being too fat or ugly. We both are trying to make changes when it comes to this so that we have an equal amount of intimacy and emotional connection in our marriage. We are also a bit uncertain about our family dynamics. His brother has a wicked wife that is trying to split up the family and my husband and I kind of bicker back and forth about how this affects the family. One thing we can agree on, it is destroying his family. Over all, my husband and I have a very loving, deep connection and I know I want to be with him for the rest of my life and so does he.",140,3.5,5,4,4,6,5.25
Certain I am very certain that my partner loves me a lot. She is a very faithful and devoted wife. We share a lot in common. As a couple we like going places and making great memories. She is always positive about doing things together. Both of us love gardening and do it together most of the times. We love food and cooking. She is a great baker and I like making meat dishes. We complement each other. We are certain about our financial goals as a couple. Each week we sit down and review our financial position and how we are doing towards our savings and retirement goals. We shop a lot together. She loves buying clothes for both of us and I buy mostly gadgets and household goods.   Uncertain We are uncertain to some extent whether we want to have kids right now or some time later. She is focused on her career and don't want this decision to hamper her professional prospects. We want to have kids for sure but not certain about the timing. We are also uncertain if we should invest in real estate. We are thinking for a long time to buy  a second house but are very uncertain looking at the current political and economic condition.,46,4.5,5,4,5,6,5.38
"I am certain that our relationship is strong and that we are very good at communicating. We are a strong team that definitely pushes each other to be better and to achieve our goals. We have achieved a lot since we have been together and have made a lot of dreams comes true. Personal dreams and dream of our relationship.  We are definitely quick to have a heart to heart if we feel that something needs to change or if we are unhappy about a certain aspect of whatever situation may arise. Coming from a broken family, the uncertainty is always there of ""will this relationship ACTUALLY be able to go the distance"". Although right now you feel that you're different and you're doing everything so perfect, you never know what the future holds. For someone who never in their wildest dreams could imagine that their parents would split it, it actually did when I was in my early twenties. When people divorce after 30 years together, it makes you questions your own relationship and wonder if anything is even worth it, if we're just going to go through heartache in the future. And in the back of my head I always have that uncertainty is my partner loves me the same amount as I do and if they are secretly holding back things that will cause our relationship to implode one day.",86,4,2,4,4,6,5.25
"Currently we are pretty happy about everything. We are secure in our work and home life. We seem to be happy to the point we are planning on getting married in a year or two. We both are happy with sex, money, issues in the relationship, and how we handle issues if the problems arise. We are level headed so if something does go wrong we dont run around with our heads cut off. We are also on the same page as how many kids we want and even the type of house we want. Overall we are pretty good right now and I dont see anything major that would cause us to not like each other or cause a breakup.   As far as things that are uncertain, its mostly issue with the job. We both work at stable places but they want to sometimes send us to other offices in different cities. This sucks and normally dont like it but its normally short for a few weeks and we do get through it pretty well. My girl friends job wants to post her perm out of state because shes pretty good at getting things done there. Problem is mostly should she quit her job or should I and then find another if we do move. I wont just leave her over a job but it is a little stressful.",83,4,5,3,5,5,5.13
"The one thing I am most certain about in our relationship is that we have very similar goals when it comes to training, nutrition, taking care of our bodies and building our physiques in order to make them not only impressive visually but also healthy inside out at the same time. I‚Äôm certain that having similar goals in that regard helps us a lot when we go out. Our food choices at the restaurants are restricted because we don‚Äôt simply eat everything. We count the macronutrients and overall calories in everything we consume so it is of vital importance our food choices to fit our eating protocol and to coincide with one another. I‚Äôm certain that we are both benefiting by being in a relationship and taking care of our nutrient needs.  The one thing I‚Äôm not really certain of is whether she likes my entertainment choices or not. What I mean by that is that the TV shows and movies I choose to watch with her might not appeal to her taste as much as she wants to show to me. Maybe I am imagining things but I don‚Äôt think her favorite genres are Science Fiction and Fantasy and she just acts in that way because she doesn‚Äôt want to break my heart by not being so enthusiastic about those Movies/shows that I adore.",76,3.5,4,4,4,6,5
"Things I am certain about: that I love this man with all my heart, body and soul; that I am IN love with him; he means the world to mean; I would be miserable without him; He's my best friend. I'm pretty much certain about all things surrounding the fact that I love him. I'm certain about the interests that we share and where we have our differences. I'm certain about the way he thinks and feels about things on a moral scale. I know we enjoy spending time together because we are bursting with fun and energy when we do. And long for each other when we are apart. I know we enjoy each other.   I am not uncertain about many things when it comes to my relationship with him. I love him and that is what matters. Some things I'm not certain about include: If he actually needs me the way I need him; If we will be together forever ( thought I think and hope and wish this to be true), If he really knows how much I love him. Uncertain if we want more kids, I'm not sure how he feels and I'm not really sure how I feel.. we should probably talk about that soon.",34,5,5,5,5,5,5.06
"My husband and I met in high school and are now in our early 30's. We've weathered many tough situations together including relocating, career changes, and medical issues. Time after time, my husband has shown me that he cares and that he stands behind me 100% of the time. I feel that my husband and I have a nearly rock solid relationship that has what it takes to last.   We have now have two boys together, one 4 years old and the other just 2. We have shared ownership of our home for over 5 years. My husband works hard to provide for all of the finer things that we all enjoy. The both of us come from troubled backgrounds so we really find great comfort in being able to relate to one another. I feel like I can be completely honest with my husband. He's not very judgmental at all and gives me very sound advice whenever I need it.  I feel like I've come to know my husband really well and cannot imagine any other life without him. I'm certain of our relationship because I don't ever want to be without him. In May of this year we celebrate 10 years of marriage and I look forward to many, many more.",50,6,5,4,6,6,5.06
"We are married so we have long since established our set behaviors. I am certain that our relationship is pretty strong. We both care about how the other is feeling and doing in life. We both have similar ideas about money management. We are on the same page mostly politically more or less. We both can tolerate missed dishes or messy rooms. Neither of us want children.  Uncertainty lies in a few areas. For me I have some health issues and feel less than at times. It makes me think I am dragging him down with me since it's hard to be employed with them. If they progress I worry it will be very hard on our relationship. Medical bills have made our stress levels go up a bit money wise.  Also I want a dog. He is not very big on adding responsibilities to our life. While he knew I'd get one eventually, I worry it will add strain to our relationship. If I get worse some of that will fall to him to take care of so I can see his concern.  He is also going back to school. He is already employed and has a degree but he wants to help out the emergency management for our county and it would require an added certificate. So we will have less time together to bond and further cement our relationship. Also if the fafsa doesn't cover everything we will have to add on to our financial burdens which I already stretch.  Also I am going away for a month or two to visit my sister. She lives quite far away from us so we will have to keep touch with a phone or computer games. He doesn't like me gone that long so that will add to any tension we have already going.",137,5,4,5,4,6,5.06
"We're both on the same page and are certain about what we want in life. We discuss our plans and views we have towards the future, we discuss monetary issues and goals, we have a set plan for the both of us which is progressing at this point. We are also certain about the feelings for each other, we've discussed this at length and I can feel comfortable knowing how my partner feels. We've been together so long that everything that interfered or could cause issues with the relationship has disappeared. I know that I can trust and rely on my partner and that she trust that I will do the right thing all the time.  I'm uncertain about day to day things that I think most people are. For example things like where we should keep living, who we should keep getting a long with and meeting. This depends on the person. I like some people that my wife is not fond of and she has some friends that I don't like. This is usually a point of contention however in the end, it's what makes each other happy that counts, so we don't dwell on it.  We're also uncertain about the dynamics of job and working. My wife wants to work less and I want to work more to save more money. While those issues are minor and they rarely come up, they are still an uncertainty.",94,3.5,5,3,5,6,5.19
"Well my wife and I have been together for 11 years now.  I really can connect with her on almost every level.  We are into the same things, like sports and food.  We love to go out to the game and have a nice time just watching it and having a beer and something good to eat.  She is always able to really be there for me when I need something and really most of the time she can sense when I need something.  I was attracted to her the moment I meet her even though we were just friends when we first meet.  Even with all of the great things that our relationship offers the one thing that I am not always certain about is her sexual desire for me.  She has not always been the most forth coming when it comes to things of that nature.  She has almost never initiated a sexual encounter and seems a bit put off most of the time when we are together.  I have always asked her about how she is feeling when it comes to our intimate relationship but I do not always feel that she is giving me an honest answer.  I just really am always on the fence when it comes to how see feels about our sex life and would really like to get to the bottom of the problem whether it is me or something that she is hung up on.",99,3,3,5,3,6,5
"We have a very open relationship we talk about anything and everything and Iam luck enough to have found somebody who has my same values,morals, and wants. We very seldom disagree. We both love we the are at in the relationship and where we are going. My partner treats me with the upmost respect and cares for me, Iam very luck to have found her, and I treat her the same way. If anything was uncertain about our relationship it would be that she is a state away and Iam starting a new job soon, and Iam trying to work out how to be closer to her and spend as much if not more time with her, while starting a new job, while I have two choices, one doesnt close the distance gap, so Im kinda of scared to take it, although it pays well, and I havent brought this up to her yet, I would like to see her move closer to me, however she has a child and family where she is now, so I hate to ask or bring it up. I know she will say we can work through it, but it bothers me greatly at this time. Thats the only really uncertain thing at this time. Im very certain and secure in our relationship and so is she, when I have questions or she has questions we simply sit down and talk about it, we dont hide anything or ignore stuff, our rule is communication, if you have any questions or doubts we bring them up and discuss them, Iam so lucky to have found her, because we agree on our relationship and how to maintain it, while we may disagree on a few other things, our relationship is stable, happy, and will last for a long time.",135,4.5,5,4,5,6,4.81
"Most of my relationship is based around certainty. We knew each other for a very long time before we started dating, so we knew who each other was and what they wanted before we started dating. Our relationship has had a high level of communication and we talk about everything. I am certain she loves me. I am certain she wants to be with me. I am certain she is loyal to me and that she trusts me to be loyal to her.   The only thing I am really uncertain about is children. We both want children, or at least we say we do, but we don't talk about it much, or when we do talk about it, it's more like a fantasy than something that is actually going to happen. I sometimes feel that she likes the idea of having children, and the she herself really does believe she wants children, but that somewhere deep down she actually doesn't. I've raised this concern to her and she assures me she wants children, but I still don't know if she's being honest with herself. This would be a deal breaker if she actually does not want children. We have invested a lot of time into each other and I want to be with her, but I have to have children at some point.",71,4,4,3,5,5,5
"I have been in my relationship for over 10 years. We both don't want children and never did. That I am certain of. I am very happy about that because I never wanted children. I also know that we love each other very much. We also are interested in the same things, like anime, video games, and photography. He loves golf, though, which I can't stand and that takes up a lot of his time. We do have issues with time. We both work a lot and don't have as much time for each other anymore. It's hard finding time when he has his hobbies and I have mine after work. It's also hard because we aren't married, but are living together. I want to get married soon, but he wants to wait. This puts a strain on things. I would love to get married, but he just doesn't see the point right now. I think it would help us financially and we could try to save up for a house. It's hard living in the bay area where things are so expensive. It puts a strain on our finances. I'd like to move, but he doesn't. So, we don't agree on those things. He also has kind of let himself go and gained weight and I don't like that. He's not as attractive as he used to be. I want him to lose weight, but he doesn't care and says he's too busy with work.",104,2,3,3,3,6,5.06
"I am certain that we do love each other and care for each other's well being. We have a good time when we are together and the feeling after all these years in the relationship have not went away. We encourage each other to do our best and support the strength and belief in oneself to strive for excellence in our lives. We also find each other attractive which is important as emotional compatibility in the relationship. We are able to talk about almost everything with no judgement that we probably have not told others. I do consider my partner my best friend and I know the feeling is mutual too.  The downside is not many but there are a few internal struggles on my part, a little on his that makes me question the state of our relationship.  At times it reach a massive blowup where I will feel bad afterwards. There are also external factors too that makes me unhappy and then  I question my relationship. Not often but when a issue(s) crops up, I'm not exactly a full of sunshine to be around, I must admit. I also wondered when we will get married and back of my head wonders do he truly want to marry me.",37,4,4,4,5,5,4.94
"At this point, I feel my partner and I agree that our relationship is one that is going to last. We both have some doubts from time to time. I'm not always certain that we are right for each other. We have very different personalities that conflict quite a bit at times. Our styles of communication are very different, which sometimes do not mesh well. I prefer to avoid while he prefers to tackle things head on. We also have very different love languages regarding how we express and wish to receive love. It is very hard differing so much across these very important aspects of relationship. I feel that we just don't really understand one another in many instances; however, we both make an effort to work towards a better understanding of one another's needs and desires. One thing I am certain of is our devotion and commitment to one another. I am quite certain that we both want the same things from the relationship. We both have expressed a desire to spend our lives together. We both want this relationship to last for the long haul, with both of us reaching pure happiness together. I am absolutely certain of those things. I am still uncertain how or if we will achieve that.",52,3.5,3,4,4,5,4.81
"There are a few things that I am certain of in the relationship right now. We are both happy with the way things are, we're supportive of each other and want to help each other to succeed in our individual goals. I'm certain that when we have some type of problems, whether minor or major, we can get through them because we have good communication. I know that we both view the relationship as a long term thing and neither of us are anticipating finding someone else they'd rather be with.  One of the major things I am uncertain about is the possibility of children. I've made it clear that it's not something I'm interested in and I think she still wants me to change my mind about it. We do talk about it sometimes but it's not something that can be easily resolved so it's always just something that gets put off for the future and I don't know what will happen. We are also not living together yet but should be making that move soon. I am a little uncertain about whether or not we will be compatible in that regard. I think things will work out fine but there is always some doubt when you get that close to someone.",48,3,3.5,4,4,5,4.81
"i am quite certain that we can coexist as a relationship unit.  we both have similar likes and dislikes.  our hobbies coincide so we can get along with many things that we do in our leisure time.  we have a strong sense of family and happiness that guides us to have a compatible relationship. i am certain that whatever problems we have we can work through for our long term commitment.  i am certain that whenever we go on vacation we will have a great time together site seeing and going to different clubs to enjoy the scenes.  i am certain that when it is time to do chores around the house, we both can participate and help each other with the work that needs to be done. .  i am uncertain that all this happiness can last for the rest of our lives  you never know when a tragic accident can occur and it can all be over in a moments notice.  i am uncertain that when there is a petty argument that it can't be stopped into a big argument that can cause unnecessary problems.  i am uncertain that during times of immediate family crises that sadness will not subside and we will have to go through hard times to grow our relationship.  i am uncertain if our likes for hobbies will continue as well.",78,4.5,5,4,4,6,4.88
"I'm certain that my wife loves me and I'm certain that I have the same mutual love for her. I'm pretty certain that we equally love our family that we've created and we wouldn't change the for the world. I'm certain that though we may argue and say that we are leaving sometimes that it's not going to happen because we have a house that we've both but our money and time into. I'm uncertain of how long the relationship will last in the long run, though, as ""forever"" is a very long time and I'm sure she feels the exact same way (I know her). I'm uncertain that our relationship progressing; it's actually rather complacent so I'm not sure if that's going to hurt us in the future. Also I'm not sure how long our sex life will continue to keep up, as it's already went a little down hill since all of the kids were born. We used to go at it like rabbits for the first few years but now we are so busy with everything else that sex is not on either one of our minds, it seems. The last thing I'm uncertain about is my wife's family; not that I'm uncertain about how they feel about me, but rather the fact that I don't too much care for them and a lot of the time my wife allows them to interefere in our relationship.",95,3,3,3,4,6,4.81
"Well when our relationship started, it felt a lot more like a friends-with-benefit relationship for a couple months, we didn't really know if we were boyfriends or not because we were inexperienced and did not really want to talk about it. However, with time we started talking more and we officially announced ourselves as boyfriends and honestly it felt really well. We currently do not live together and he barely uses his phone so we do not talk a lot during the day but i am confident that he is loyal to me but you can never be certain. I am certain that he equally loves me as much as I love him now that we've been dating for a little over a year but I am uncertain on whether or not he wants to see me as much as I want to see him. I am kind of the kind that gets attached too quickly and loves to cuddle at night while he is the independent kind of guy and prefers sex then cuddling. Our libido isn't the same. To be honest, you can never really be certain if someone loves you as much as you do until you ask them to marry you knowing there's no other aspect of it encouraging them to do it (money). But each relationship is an adventure to its own, and it is up to the relationship people to achieve their adventure to the fullest.",97,3.5,3,4,4,6,4.19
"I am certain that we were connected for a divine purpose.  I fully understand the complex nature of our relationship given our spiritual beliefs.  I am certain that we both have a deep love for each other.  I am certain that we both have a deep respect for each other.  I am certain that at this time I am the only one in her life and she is the only one in my life romantically.  I am certain that her actions our clear in regards to how important I am to her.  Although sometimes I am uncertain if she knows how important she is to me.  Even though, we both agree that their are boundaries currently in place in regards to how we can express our romantic feelings that we have toward each other, we have been delicately trying to approach alternatives way to redefining our relationship in hope to guarantee longevity.  We have agreed to independently handle the feelings that we have that conflict with our spiritual belief and many of times we remain silent on these feelings.  Every now and then we will briefly acknowledge that we still have issues reconciling them and attempts to perhaps put distance between each other just do not work.  Somehow we find ourselves back into the same rhythm we've had since I first met her.  Seldom are we apart so I'm uncertain if I can interpret that as if we will continue to maintain the relationship for what it is.  We are not seeking to compare it to others.  We are not defining it by anyone else's standards.  That is what I am certain about.  I am uncertain that because of our spiritual beliefs if we try to force the dynamics of our relationship to change that perhaps we won't last.  I am uncertain and I would almost bet that she is uncertain if our spiritual beliefs will allow our relationship to continue to grow and blossom.  I love her and she loves me that we are both certain of but uncertain just how far and how long the love will keep us together.",146,3.5,3,4,4,6,3.81
"The status of our relationship is great so far. I feel that we have much more positives than negatives. Our positives are we both are the non-argumentive type. We rarely get into arguments or disagreements. We also are both into religion. I feel that brings us and our families closer together. Personally, I am very committed to our relationship and have plans for us in the near future. On the other hand, we do have some negatives as well. We are uncertain about when and where we want to have children. I want us to wait until were settled down in a better place and possibly a new state. My partner wants a child asap but is willing to look from my point of view. Every now and then we do argue, but quickly make up. Also, us working so much means were not able to spend as much time together. I work during the days and she works during the evening some days. We have never had any issues as far as cheating, commitment, etc. I believe that my partner shares the same opinion about our relationship as I do. We both very happy and eager to start the next step.",9,3.5,5,2,5,5,4.13

Very helpful person for my partner. Everyday we are enjoying with our own life, I say one thing share with you because this is very awesome moment in my life, one day me and my partner walk with the road, this time was rainy moment, we are see in old couple in cross the road, That old lady very take care for that old man. This moment change in our life because we are how many ages comes but not we will fight or any sorrows, Still we going this relationship and same sweet relationship going in our end life.

"We started dating 7 years ago. Even now, I‚Äôm unsure if our feelings are mutual. He is a lot more affectionate than in the beginning but that, too, is fleeting sometimes. I‚Äôm not sure if he is in the relationship, because he needs me or has genuine caring feelings for me.  Other than that, he is silly and does things to make me feel warm, smile and envoke my curiousity often. Everyday, I look forward to seeing and being in his company.  The things that I‚Äôm certain about is that we will be together for a long time. During that time, I will enjoy his company. He will continue to be himself that I have enjoyed for years. Our personalities won‚Äôt change much.  The things I am uncertain about are his feelings for me. What my feelings will be for him once he gets older. Will I be as patient? I think about our health a lot. Will I be able to be there for him as I have been? Will we have the same relationship once we cannot spend as much time together? Will it actually improve our relationship?  I am considering having a kid. I‚Äôm also not sure how he feels about that. Sometimes it seems like he likes kids and sometimes he does not.",59,2,3,2,3,6,3.69

"I am certain about how much she loves me and were we are going together. we talk all the time and discuss what going on in eachothers lifes. We talk about our sex lives and what we want out of the relationship, we both have decided that we are the ones for eachother. I am certain of how i feel about her and her about me. One thing im no certain about is what going to happen with her sister. im afraid her sister and her boyfriend are going to split up and my Girlfriend will want to take in her sister and I cant stand her sister. I dont like how she treats my girlfriend. I told her a few weeks ago if she moved in with us I would have to move out and she got really upset about it but i dont know what else to do. Im also no certain that I want kids and she does and that causes problems because even though she is in her 20s she still is worried about getting to old to have them. But none the less we have a good realtionship we just need to work on some stuff.",4,3.5,3,3,5,4,4.56
"Actually we both are most certain about our  relationship in the way that we trust each other heartfully to the core, and we respect each other, and also defend each incase unwanted troubles,  which we have proved over time for each other so much and hence we have overcomed all our egos, doubts, and misunderstandings in a big way,Which has helped us very much stay in genuine love, infront of others with pride and conviction, this is for sure, and hence we have become rolemodel to other pairs who are struggling in life, to understand each other, and finally we both have got that courage also, to make it big in life, commercially with lot of love for each other.  And  then uncertainty is only about our families, as whether they support us or not, in future for our happy life, as they are finding it difficult to trust us in all the ways, because of the differences in caste, creed, culture, languages, status etc, where they are worried about what people talk socially, which can damage their  self respects and status that they have earned all these years, hence they just want win win options, till then they are not all fully convinced about us.",25,5,3,3,5,6,4.19
"In my relationship, I am very certain that my partner is committed to me in certain ways. She does care about me and thinks about me during the day. She does want to make me happy when I get home and take care of house chores. She does seem to really value my opinion and ask me for my various opinions and suggestions on a daily basis. She wants to know about my life and think about life in new and exciting ways with me. We do both want to eventually have children together and share our life experiences with them together. We both like to partake in similar activities and go to similar locations and places. There are a few things that I am uncertain about. We do seem to disagree a lot in arguments that we have with each other. We don't like the same kinds of television shows or programs. She doesn't care about her health as much as I seem to value it. I often wonder how smart she is because she doesn't think about long term goals as much as I do. We do seem to argue a lot and disagree on certain topics. I often wonder if we are a good couple because of reasons such as these. She doesn't like sports as much as I do. She doesn't work as hard at certain things as I would like her to. We don't have the same ideas about how our house should look or what kinds of animals we should have. She likes cats and I like dogs. She eats too much food in my opinion and i'm not sure If there is anything that I will ever be able to do about that. I don't know if these things are all important but I figure that I should mention them just in case. I hope that what I wrote is very helpful for this HIT, because I am really trying to think of several things that I can write about. Hopefully we can both agree to disagree with certain things, because we are a great couple and we should really care about each other and take our time to understand that we are good for each other. It is hard to find someone who is perfect, and so I don't want to waste my time looking for perfection. She is a gre",152,2.5,4,4,4,6,3.31
"Well honestly , our relationship is kind of weird. I'm certain that we both love each other tremendously . We have fun and can talk and enjoy each others company for hours. Though, I'm uncertain of the extent of her love, like how much does she really care for me - to be with me for the long term. We both have the same goals, to be successful in our careers and start a family someday. I'm just not sure if it will be with each other at this point. I know I'm committed to the long term, but I could not be certain she is thinking the same thing. I think she feels she does not have much time left, as far as starting a family is concerned. Meanwhile, I want to focus on my job, etc and stability before that. And being the beautiful woman that she is, I know that she thinks she may have better options when it comes to getting whats she wants , even though she loves me. I love her and want to make things work, but one thing I'm sure off, is that if not, I will be ok. I'm certain this is the person I would want to be with for the long run.",31,2.5,3,3,4,5,4.19
"I am certain that this relationship will not end soon and that it still has life left in it. There are numerous things that give me hope that the relationship will persevere and that we will have a future together. It is that time in our relationship that we have to decide if we want to take it to the next level or stop wasting each other's time and whatever happens I will be ok with it. Since there is no way of knowing the future we will have to wait and see. There are a lot of things that I am uncertain about and one of them is if we get married and have children together, will we stay together. I know that a lot of things change once a person has children and your priorities have to change. I am not exactly sure If we will get through tough periods together since we have not really had anything major to go through. I really have doubts if she will be strong enough or supportive enough to go through any major life changes with me. There are also other factors to consider such as what our financial situation would be since we will have a lot more expenses. I guess that you are not going to know everything until it happens and you have lived through it, but I am hoping for the best outcome.",88,3,3,4,4,4,4.63
"Our relationship has only been going on for a short while but it has shown that we get along very easily. We know for certain that we understand each other on almost all major relationship issues and we talk about most issues as they come up to try to settle them out if it is a major enough issue. Most of the time after talking it is usually figured out that there is not much we disagree with after all, and we are mainly just looking at solving the same problem and getting to the same resolution, but with just a different pathway to get there. We know for certain we can get along and communicate well, enough that we know that if we do have a problem, its most likely easily resolved by just a quick talk and clarification. Uncertainty in the relationship might come from more of a long term aspect, since we are a couple that has not had that long of a time together. We both know that over time some issue do develop, but we don‚Äôt know if or when that will ever take place. I hope not, but going by statistics and direct information from friends, it would be almost oddly rare to have no major issues come up. Have we not had the life experience to reveal if we do have a major problem? Trust is also grown over time, so maybe there is a little uncertainty on not knowing if what they have revealed to me on future goals and wants out of life are not true, or slightly different then they explained to me.",122,4,4,5,4,5,4.25
"The things I feel very certain about in my relationship with my partner regard our commitments and our values. No matter what is going on in the relationship, I feel assured that my partner and I will continue to commit to one another, that we will share the same values consistently. I am also certain that we will do well with one another into the future; I feel optimistic about the state of my relationship. I trust in the feeling that while we may not be soul mates, we are in love and we will work hard for each other. I am most uncertain, however, about things outside of my control that may put an end to our relationship. Sometimes I can't control things that happen. For example, if health complications arrived unexpectedly, this would be an uncertainty. One can never truly predict the future in regard to health, happiness, and such things. Further, there is the uncertainty that both my partner and I will continue to change throughout our lives together. The people we were when we got together might be very different from who we are at the end, whenever the end is. All in all, I feel certain that our relationship can weather any kinds of disagreements. I also feel certain that the two of us will be successful in life, together.",75,5,4,4,5,5,4.88
"I am certain that we love each other, we enjoy talking to each other and we are friends. Also, i am certain that we like to spend time together. We share many interests in common. We like the same type of movies such as superhero, action, thrillers and comedies. I am certain that we have similar goals in life. One goal is to increase our income so we can have more free time and be able to travel without worrying about budget or finances. In addition, I am certain that we share the same spiritual values. We worship together as a couple and we believe the same core principles of Christianity.  Finally, I am certain that we appreciate the simple things in life. Sometimes we just like to sit home, eat a good meal and watch a movie. This makes us both totally happy.   Things that I am uncertain about in my relationship is how he feels at time. My partner has a tendency to remain stoic during all situations. he is hard to read, therefore I am not certain how he truly feels about a situation. I ask him and he tells me how he feels but you never really see it in his behavior because he has one mode. This makes me feel a little uncertain, because you definitely have to believe what he says. There is no emotional response to view from him. Another thing I am uncertain about is his plans for us after the kids are finished with school. I suggested we move or travel and just experience the freedom of the empty nest. He has not really said yes or no. It makes me wonder if he really wants to do anything at all. I do not know if I want to continue to live in this city for the rest of my life therefore if he does not want to move do I leave him or just spend extra time traveling. I want to maintain my relationship but I want to experience new things too.",144,3.5,3,4,4,6,5.5
I am very certain about where my relationship stands.  We both have a very clear path on what we want to come in the future for us.   I feel as if we both can relate and we both understand what it is that we want in the end .  I guess i can say that i am certain that we would both like get married one day. I am also very certain that she loves me as much as i love her .  Some things that i am uncertain about in my relationship is where we will be in the future because nobody can determine the future .  Other things that i am uncertain about is if we will make it to marrige because of the price that it cost to have a wedding now days can be very expensive and has lots of fees that come along with that .  I am very certain that we will make it work in the end because we are both very compatible together and we have very good communication skills as a couple .  I am uncertain that she will feel the same as she does now in the future because nobody can determin the future that is .,2,4.5,5,3,5,5,4.06
"1) Certain things about my partner is she is so caring and then most of the time we were always caring for each othr we spend most of the times outside we were very much connected she helps me in all axpect in terms of love and support she may not talk toomuch and didn't interfere with personal matters of my life she makes interfere only that makes me worse so she always makes decision based upon the criteria which suites me will but she doesn't go beyond that so most of the time she is calm type and caring .Many teenagers just don t understand the responsibilities that go along with being sexually active, they don t even think about them. But maybe they should sit back and think before taking part. People should not be having sex just to have it, but because they are in love.For us it didn't apply.In the film Good Will Hunting, many personal relationships are displayed. From the beginning, to the end, you can see these relationships grow, while taking an evolutionary course. During the film, Will (Matt Damon), and Skylar (Minnie Driver), experienced such a course. There are six stages that they went through from the beginning to the end, to finally reach Romantic Relationship status.our relationship is just like that. thank you for giving me this oppurtunity.",82,5.5,4,3,5,6,3.38
"Sometimes I'm very uncertain about my relationship. Because I'm never sure what could happen, simply because things can happen. You really never know what could happen with it. Because everything can change and you could never know when it could happen. That's something to think about, so you need to really be cautious about relationships because anything can happen. I'm sometimes certain about it because I feel good about a person and I think that they are really good at what they do to make me feel comfortable and good about myself and the overall relationship. That alone gives me confidence in us and makes me believe that we have a future. With that it makes me understand more about relationship and how I could feel better about all of this, because you know what you have. I think having a good relationship can make you feel comfortable and make you feel comfortable with them. You need to have that because you won't be questioning yourself or questioning that relationship that you are in. That's something I think most people need and want to have so they can feel good about themselves and their partner. It'll also help the relationship and make everything better. You never want to question your partner about anything or make yourself feel very uncertain.",61,3,4,4,4,5,3.5
"I'll start with uncertainties to organize my thoughts better. The biggest one is whether we should have a kid or not. We both kind of want one, but we have different priorities and time goals for it. Sometimes I'm not sure if she likes me making new female friends even though ones I had before I met her seem fine. I also worry about her family not liking me will lead to her having doubts about us. I get worried she is upset with me when she seems distant. I wonder if love is enough for her to want to stay with someone like me. And finally, I'm currently negative about myself for gaining weight since she stays in shape. For certainties, I know we love each other. Our relationship is in a good position right now. Even though we're both focusing on work, neither of us are needy with the others attention. I trust her not to sleep with other people. We can count on each other in times of duress. Our sex life is good enough. I know if I have a hard day, she will try to make time for me if possible. I can count on her to not lie to me unless it is someone else's secret. We trust each other to get things done. We know what each other wants from our careers, and what we expect of the other person. We've talked about our futures a lot, so we both know that we're in this for the long run.",110,3.5,4,3,5,6,5.19
"In my relationship with my partner, I feel I am certain about the commitment, the feelings I have for my partner, loyalty, respect, love, care. Many things that go in everyday situations I feel connected to my partner and feel that I am certain about my future with my partner. Our relationship is strong and made for each other couple.  There are uncertain things that go around where my feelings get disturbed, I feel uncertain about our relationship when we fight, argue, quarrel, ignore. Our goals are not the same, we have completely opposite nature, that causes troublesome in many ways. Many times we don't understand each other, the feelings for each other, the respect for each other, we never discuss anything about the future, about our goals in life, our plans, these things make me feel uncertain about our relationship. I feel I have more uncertain things than certain.   We know we are committed to each other but we never share our feelings, our thoughts, we avoid many things where we can do together. It's like you do your things, I do my things. Some good interference should be there in a relationship to hold together.  Our day starts with work, ends with work.",19,1.5,3,3,3,5,3.75
"Our relationship began when I was enrolled in a PhD programme and she was working full time. Over the past two years, a lot has changed in my life as I dropped out of PhD program and had two eye operations for treatment of a rare genetic eye disease. She has mostly lived a normal life, working a relatively stable job. This has led me to question our relationship many times and I have come to certain conclusions as I discuss below.  First and foremost is that I am pretty much certain that she like me in a romantic sense and not just supporting me through a tough time. I discussed my issues with her and implied many times that we can take a break and continue later once I sort my issues out but she got rather angry at such suggestions. Also, I am aware of what she wants in life and feel that we can make this relationship work in a way that we can both get what we want. She has shown immense support to me so I know that she has loyalty and is not easily wavered. I am now pretty much ingrained in her life through her family and friends and although we have not moved in together but I am certain that if we break up then it would be very painful not only to me but to her also.  On the other hand, there are still things I feel uncertain about this relationship. I am afraid to ask her to live together, to plan for something long term and whether her feelings will remain the same if I end up with more issues that I have to deal with. I am certain about her feelings for now but still have doubts whether she will feel the same way about me if I continue to have problems living a normal life (due to my eye disease) when she is ready to settle down and whether she will see me as someone who she can commit for life.  All in all, I can say that I am satisfied with my relationship for now but due to the issues discussed, I have some doubts about it for the long term.",151,3.5,3,3,4,6,4.63
"In my relationship with a girl things are very certain and uncertain. We are very on and off. But one thing is certain, we love eachother so much, which is amazing and trmendous for everyone involved.I think one uncertainty would be our future though. Im just not sure how long we can keep this up for it. will be so so so so so so so so so so hard. I think we should try for a little bit but that is it I don't know if anything else would make sense. I think another certainty would be the fat that we get along super well. That is a really god thing. Even when things are not working out, we still respect each other and are nice enough to not make things horrible. I think that is a crucial thing for people and they would want me to be happy/. We also have caring families that get alongwith eachother. I think this is a really special thing and it makes me very happy. I love it and think it makes sense for me because I get happy around her ad hers. They are all nice and make me smile a lot.",6,3.5,2,4,4,5,3.38
"It is certain that we married and committed to each other and our family.  I am certain that our relationship will continue for a very long time, and I am fairly certain that it will continue until one  of us dies.  In order for this to change, one or both of us would have to change all of our religious beliefs and basically our entire worldview. It is uncertain how happy we will be in the  relationship.  It is uncertain that the dynamics of the relationship will remain as they are now.  It is uncertain whether we will resolve some of the ongoing issues in our relationship.  Will we  change the way we divide up work and responsibilities in our relationship as our children grow up?  Will provider and or caretaker roles change? It is uncertain exactly what our relationship  will look like a decade from now or two decades from now.  It is especially uncertain how our relationship will fare as we transition to an empty nest sometime over the next 20 years.  Will we  be able to find common goals and interest once the children are largely out of the picture?  Will we draw closer together or further apart?  All of these things are uncertain.",27,4.5,2,5,4,6,5.44
"I am confident in my relationship as far as how we get along. We were best friends for approximately 10 years before we were ever a couple. This makes it much easier to talk about important issues an it helps us both to remember that we were friends first when we are having issues that need to be resolved. I think that because we have known each other for a long time, we got to know each other in more interesting ways BEFORE we were a couple. We have known each others previous partners and witnessed each others different relationships which we also learned a lot from. We have a very solid relationship and have learned that when we can't resolve certain issues that we can try to see each others point of view from a more friendship perspective and we can usually work things through that way. I am certain that as long as we continue to make an effort to work through our issues that we can get through them, no matter how large or small.  I am uncertain about my relationship only because I wonder sometimes if we are more friends than a couple. I think I feel this way sometimes because we do all of the things that best friends do together and sometimes I feel like if someone where to come along if they might be more interesting to my partner than I am. I do not feel this way often but I do think about it. Other than that I am fairly confident in the status of our relationship.",117,3,5,4,5,5,5.38
"There are a lot of things I am certain about in my relationship with my boyfriend. We live together and I am certain that it is a long term plan to stay together for any foreseeable future. I know that we are good partners and supportive of one enough. I am certain our love is deep and mutual. I am certain that aside from the romantic relationship we are absolutely best friends. I am certain that we have a lot in common on more than a superficial level, we share political and spiritual ideology. I am uncertain that our communication is truly open and honest as we bought would rather avoid an argument and lay down an issue than risk fighting with each other. I am uncertain of how much my partner respects me as he will make choices that affect me without consulting me including having overnight company over at inappropriate times, giving away things that were either purchased together, or by me solely without asking how I feel about it first. I am uncertain if we are sexually compatible because internal issues like insecurity and self esteem along with battles with depression and anxiety sometimes interfere with our intimate time together. I am uncertain if we will get married because my partner is not sure he wants to be a step father unless we have a child together also.",84,3.5,3,4,4,6,5.38
"I feel secure in my relationship and certain about most things. I'm pretty certain that my partner and I feel the same about each other, agree on the boundaries of our relationship, and know and accept each other's strengths and weaknesses. I'm certain that we know each other very well and know how to handle issues that may come up in our relationship. Communication is a strength of ours and I feel comfortable being able to completely express my feelings freely with my partner. I'm certain that my partner is committed to me and I am committed to them. I never feel that I have to question loyalty in this relationship.  Although I'm certain about a lot of things, one thing I'm not completely certain about is the future of the relationship. I know we both want similar things, but there are a lot of obstacles in the way. There are also some issues that we don't completely agree on. The biggest issue is children; I want to wait at least 5 more years while my partner wants kids much sooner. It's not a topic that we really talk about often, but I do wonder if it will cause issues sometime in the future. Another issue that I worry about is the financial stability of both of us. We both work jobs that lack stability and it makes it difficult to really 'settle down' together. We don't live together at the moment, so there is some uncertainty of what our relationship will be like once we begin sharing bills.",112,4,4,4,5,6,5.13
"There are many certains and uncertains in my relationship with my husband. I have been with him since our junior year of high school, so it is very certain that we have loved each other from the very beginning. We are certain of our life goals and where we want to end up as old retired couples. Or at least we have discussed this in casual musings every once in a while. We are certain that we want to be the best parents we can be to our three children. We are certain we want to raise them to be well mannered productive citizens. We are certain that his career is the bread winner and most likely always will be but my career goals aren't totally out of the equation either. There are just as many uncertains to our relationship as well however. We are uncertain if we have the same goals with how many children we want, as I want more and he does not. We are uncertain how the job security on his current employer, so we may have to move in order to receive more commitment from his labor union. We are uncertain about each of our roles in the maintenance of our house and land, as I am often overwhelmed with household chores and he rarely volunteers to help me. We are sometimes uncertain as to if we should follow separate activities and goals, that would lead us further apart instead of being together. I am sometimes uncertain about both of our commitments to each other, in the aspect of sexual desires, since we have only been with each other. There are many things both good and bad in our relationship.",128,3.5,3,4,4,5,4.94
I am certain of our committment to our 3 children together. I am also certain of our love for our family in general. I am uncertain of our overall destination as he has many career goals that affect me and cause me to leave my family back home. I am sometimes uncertain of his devotion to me especially when he is stressed. I am sometimes uncertain of his ability to see my worth as we have a little time to spend together and sometimes our lives don't intersect well. I am mostly certain of my love for him and my committment overall to our marriage. I am mostly certain of my wish to be with him lifelong and my desire to build a life with him. I am mostly certain about my desire to incorporate our ideals and pass them along to our kids. I am mostly certain about our devotion to having a successful life together financially and otherwise. I am uncertain at times if he needs certain things from me such as more attention or less. I am sometimes uncertain if he really understands what I can offer to him as some parts of our life don't match up and I need more attention from him when he wants to give less. I am uncertain about some of the choices we have made together. We have some difficulties lately from choices he has made financially and this is causing me some concern.,102,3.5,3,4,4,6,5
"I'm definitely certain on the future of our relationship, but we do have a lot of problems. We are engaged and currently planning our wedding, but have some disagreements about when and who to involve, for instance. We want to get married, but sometimes we fight about stupid things. We have some communication problems but we ultimately want the same goals for a family and each other. We do have disagreements about the level of family involvement in our relationship and future marriage. He grew up being very close to his large family whereas I grew up being fairly distant from my small family, and so we have differing expectations of how often to talk to family, how often to visit and arrange vacations with family, etc. I would rather focus on fostering our own relationship so that it is stronger for when we get married and start our own family. I am a little uncertain about our financial future. I am currently the breadwinner of the household and I bring in nearly twice as much as he makes. However, he is in an apprenticeship program and his future after getting certification is uncertain. He hopes to be able to have a job that would enable me to be a stay at home mom and I support this as well. I'm just uncertain to whether he could make that work. Sometimes it's uncertain about whether he's dedicated to that sort of thing, even though we talk about it often. His actions in real life don't always match what he says (although I could say the same for myself).",120,5,3,4,4,5,4.81
"I'm certain that my partner and I love one another and enjoy being together. We get along well, are compatible in our personalities, sexually and in other ways. We like many of the same things and can always find things to do, which we both enjoy. By and large, we communicate well and rarely have any strife. We do make each other happy. We each get along with the other's families. On the uncertain side of things, I'm unsure how much longer we will be together. She's very much of a mind to want to live together and eventually get married, but I'm not. I'm twice divorced and after the last time, I determined that I definitely don't want to ever get married again. I have no desire at all to put myself in that kind of position again, or go through that experience again. I don't even want to live with anyone else right now, if ever. This has begun to put a strain on our relationship and I suspect it may well end soon. While I still believe in love and romance, I don't believe in forever. Sadly, it is what it is. She feels I don't trust her and I'm not willing to make a real commitment. It's not that I don't trust her. I just don't trust her to still feel the same way about me several years down the road, as she does now. We're in a monogamous relationship, so I certainly feel committed. But I'm no willing to merge our lives to such an extent that it would be overly difficult separating things, if and when it comes to that.",123,3,3,4,4,5,4.69
"We started dating a few months ago, and I broke off the other relationship I had for this man. I find him more appealing in a sexual way and emotional to a point so far. But there are still a few things we need to have ironed out if the relationship is to continue.   I am certain we have a special attraction for one another, he is a gentle soul who is worth the ups and downs that I see already. He reminds me of my dad and I trust my dad a lot. I am trying to compare him to him a lot and although there is also a lot of other traits not like my dad, it is something that just helps reassure me about the future in a way for some odd reason.  He needs to know where I stand firmly on how I divide my time for instance. I am certain he loves me for who I am, but there are some times where he complains too much about how much I work. I do need to pay some bills so that has to be one of the biggest priorities for me. I don't like to depend totally on a man for living situations, I have said that to him before. He thinks we can just make it on his salary and it might be true but I still like to have my own money.  I need to understand why he has the need for attention from his other friends as much as he does. He seems to collect friends on Facebook for no apparant reason other than he doesn't have many other real life friends and the support he gets online is what helps him get by as well as mine too.",133,3.5,3,3,4,6,4.69
"I am certain that we both will continue to work towards maintaining our relationship.   We will continue to work to better ourselves.  Our commitment to each other as in our relationship and life partner is strong.  No matter what, I am quite sure that we will always be there for each other- always our each other's back.  I am very certain that I can depend on him for whatever life throws at me.  I know that he will always love me in some sort of a way.  I am certain as well that he will always do what is in his best interest before he looks at mine.  I have come to find through the years that he is a narcissist, and he can making things very confusing for me.  I am sure that if he was to make any decisions on anything, he will put his interests above all.    Unfortunately, I have more uncertainty that being certain about our relationship.  I am very unsure if I can trust him to be 100% transparent with me.  His sexual needs, wants and desires are very different from my own.   Because of this, it has caused him to stray in our relationship.  All of his indiscretions have been purely physical and not emotional.  Yet- It makes me question many aspects of our relationship.  Everything from honest and truth, to desires and wants.  I know he will love me always as a person, but I do question if he is truly in love with me.  Sometimes he makes his intentions very unclear and he can be difficult to read.  It leaves me in a position to assume and generally I am totally off key to what he is truly feeling or whats.",130,3,3,3,3,5,4.81
"The status of my relationship I think is somewhat good. I do not think I will be forever with this person because they are have flaws that I do not want to deal with long term, however this partner is satisfactory for now overall. The issues I am certain about is that this person and me are in a sexual relationship. I am certain that me and this person can get along. I am certain me and this person can be friends if/when the relationship ends. I am uncertain that me and this person could stay together. I think that is not possible over the long term because we both want different things in the end. I am uncertain that I would want this person to be the mother to my children. I am uncertain that this relationship is real when it comes to what we tell each other. I am uncertain that I could trust this person to not betray me over something that would harm their well being if they did not betray me. I am uncertain that this relationship is not one based on convenience rather than true romance. I am uncertain that my partner feels the exact same way about our goals that I do.",35,2,2,3,4,6,4.5
"Well, my relationship is a complicated thing. It started out as a distraction during a particularly depressive state. I occasionally find people to cyber/text with when I get bored. He grew on me and so we stayed in the relationship. I'm sorta coming out of my depression and that makes the relationship seem iffy somehow. I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who is more depressed than I am. Although that doesn't make much sense, since originally it was me that was more depressed than he was. But at least I acknowledge my depression and holy shit I didn't realize I felt this way. oh lord this is only 100 words. The things I'm certain of in my relationship are that he loves me. Or at least he very much needs me. I like taking care of people so at least our relationship fills that need. I also like not having ot pay rent or worry about bills. Those aren't really about the relationship though I guess. I am also certain he's an enabler. I don't know if he does it because he just doesn't care, or he does it because he likes me being chubby/fat. It's kind of annoying to be perfectly honest.",29,2,3,3,3,5,4.13
"My relationship has been in an odd state.  Last year we had a lot of problems.  My partner relapsed on his drinking, and I was very angry.  He spent the last year working on those things, and he is doing better.  But, in that year a lot of things struggled.  While my partner was in treatment, he wasn't working.  This put all the financial strain on me.  That was very stressful, and I was somewhat resentful that I had to be a caregiver.  In the last few months, my partner started working again, and that has helped.  We fight a lot less, but I think there are still big issues.  There is very little romance, affection, or sex in our relationship.  I have gained weight, and don't feel great about myself.  I get the feeling my partner isn't attracted to me anymore, but he won't admit it.  I decided to focus on fixing myself, and see what happens.  On the plus side, we are getting along a lot better, and I feel we are starting to work more as a team.  We spend more time doing leisure activities together, and we seem to enjoy being around each other.  That was missing in the past year.  We are also cautiously talking about future plans, which gives me a sense of hope.  I'd say things are improving, but until our sex life resumes normally, I'm not sure if I'll stay in this relationship.  Sex is important to me, and the lack of it makes me feel like my partner is just a roommate.  I'd say my relationship is a work in progress, and i'm not at all certain how things will turn out or where we'll end up.  I can say that things are better than they were a year ago, and that feels a lot better.",136,2,2,3,4,6,4
"The thing I am most certain about in my relationship is the fact that we will stick together no matter what kind of madness we go through. We both have depression and anxiety pretty badly, so we'll have freakouts, we'll have times when we blow up in each others faces. But since we're both quite aware of it, we're really good at managing it for both ourselves and each other. Our relationship is a very stable base for living life as a depressed person. Also, we're very good at doing what is best for both of us. Be it working, or food or anything, we always do it with each other in mind. Things I am uncertain about is how long it will last. While we support each other very well, we also have ever changing brain chemistry due to the antidepressants, we're changing our pasttimes and likes/dislikes due to therapy and antidepressants. So while we will always be available for each other, the passion and the love may change to really good friends that have sex occasionally. But in the end either way will be all good because Its been an amazing time and I've learned a lot that will benefit me for years to come.",26,4,3,3,5,6,3.94
Sometimes depending on the day I can feel very certain about my relationship simply because I think everything is going steady. Me and my partner sometimes can feel good about what we do because you have something special and a lot of times that cannot be replaced when you think about it. Sometimes you can feel very good about what you do since you have something good there in that sense. Sometimes I feel very good about my situation and in others I don't feel that good about the situation I'm in because I can feel very underappreciated and uncertain about the relationship that I'm in. You really never know how you're going to feel. It just depends on that mood and the overall way you feel about something. Sometimes I don't feel anything. But usually I feel good and I feel like I'm very certain about the relationship that I'm in and that we can make things work for the better with us because it's always a good thing to see that we are able to talk things out. Communication is very key overall because without it you'll probably always feel very uncertain about a relationship because you don't know what or how your partner feels about certain things or situations and scenario's that you have both been through. So communication plays a big factor into what and how you feel about a person and what you can do for them and they can do for you.,108,4,3,3,4,5,4
"I am certain that I love my husband, I do not think that will ever change.  For the most part, I think that he loves me and wants us to be together for the rest of our lives.  The thing that I am really uncertain about is his drinking problem.  When we first moved in with each other I noticed he was drinking a lot.  Within a month he became abusive.  I have left him about 15 or more times already.  Each time he would promise to do better and I would come back.  For 3 years he has been amazing.  The physical abuse stopped completely, and he only drank about 2 times a month.  Within the past two years he got a maintenance job and he has to work 7 days for the most part.  About a year and a half ago he started drinking regularly again and said he was under a lot of stress with his job and that he was always tired.  He still has not been physically abusive but now he is verbally and mentally abusive.  I have threatened to leave, but I love him and I know what kind of person he is capable of being.  I have begged and begged for him to please get some help.  He at this point does not think that he has a problem.  It upsets me very much and spend about 5 days out of the week crying myself to sleep.  I want to be with him and I love him but I just do not know how much more of this I can stand.  He has broken me down until I feel like there is nothing left of me.  I wonder if I do leave and stay gone for about a month if he will see that I am not playing and get help, but on the other hand I wonder if he will just drink even more and end up doing things that he will later regret.  I am certain about how much I love him, but I am also certain that I cannot take much more of this.",148,1.5,3,3,2,6,4.88
"Some things that are certain about this relationship are that, I do most of the house work. She hardly ever cleans anything, I do the laundry, she always TALKS about doing the laundry but never does. She never does the dishes. NEVER. I have to make the bed, sweep, tidy up the junk around. Don't even get me started on the junk she has laying around. I just want to pick it all up and put it on her desk. I'm certain that I'm stuck in this relationship.I know that is stupid to say, but I'm stuck. I don't think I want to break up with her, I've stuck it out this long right? Over 3 years. I'm very certain I'm going to stay with her. I'm certain she is ruining my friendships with my friends. I never get to see them, If I do hang out with them GOD FORBID I'm with them for more then 1 hour If I ever want to do something I have to ask and beg. But if she wants to go do something, I better let her or do it with her our she pouts like a baby. As far as things I'm uncertain about, I'm uncertain if she is even trying in this relationship. Maybe she feels the same way, she is going this stuff on purpose to try and get me to leave her. Maybe she wants to leave me to, but she is scared to also. I'm very uncertain what she wants out of this. I'm uncertain if I ever want to be in it anymore. Why do I stay? She stops me from doing what I want in life! Its like a terrible drug addiction that I can't quit even though it is hurting me, I know I would be so much more happy alone. I just want to be alone.",138,1,2,3,2,6,4.88
What I'm certain about is how well we know each other. How good we get along and how much we've been through. I'm certain that we do love each other. I'm certain we are a good match and have stuff in common. I'm certain we've had our good times and our bad times. I'm certain that there are bad times to come since we've been going through bad times for the past few months. I'm uncertain whether or not we're going to stay together. I'm uncertain whether or not I still feel the same way I used to. I'm uncertain about a lot of things in my relationship right now. It's kind of like we're just so used to each other and that we're almost roommates. It's really hard to tell where things will go from here. Some days I wake and think that I still love them but there are times when I just want to break up and go explore the world around me and get into different relationships with other people. It's almost like I'm just bored and I don't know if just being bored is justified to end a long relationship or not. I'm just uncertain about many things.,8,3,1,3,4,6,3.81
"I am certain about our relationship because we have children together.  This makes our relationship much more concrete and real because there are other lives involved in it.  We have a life together, we have pets, we have two very small children, and we have mutual goals that we have set together.  I know that he sees a future together because he believes that if we have kids, we are together for life, so I know where he stands.  He does not believe in raising children separately.  I also know that we are together, and we are actively trying to work on our problems and ourselves together. However, aside from those things, I feel very uncertain about our relationship for a number of reasons.  For one, my boyfriend is an ex criminal who is on parole, and he has had some very close calls to violating, so there is still a chance he may go back to prison.  He is okay for half the time, but the other half he is reckless, violent, obnoxious, dangerous, unruly, and defies authority.  Also, he has a very hard time keeping a job, so our finances are constantly in a whirlwind.  They are always changing and I had the instability, and it makes me want to leave him.  Aside from those things, he is an alcoholic and he gets rude, mean degrading, and abusive when he is drunk.  So I am uncertain that I will stay with him.",101,2,3,3,2,6,3.94

"I think it is a really complex and difficult relationship. On one end I am sure that this person has good feelings for me, I am certain on that, however, exactly what it is, I have no clue; I can't really tell if this person actually loves me, or is just emotionally attached to me. I really have no clue where this is going to end, I really do wish the best for this relationship, I would love to spend the rest of my life with this person, but unless we make some changes, it is not going to happen. So there are a lot of things I am certain and uncertain about. Many things I am negative about but at the same time many things I am positive and happy about. I am uncertain if we are gonna last at all, I am uncertain of what exactly it is she feels, what she wants, what she hopes and wish for. I am certain that she is a good and caring person, with nice feelings and good intentions. At the end of the day, if we both still care and feel for each other, is just to keep pushing, keep the wheels spinning and hope for the best.",30,2,2,3,4,6,3
"Overall I feel more uncertain about my relationship than certain. I often question the longevity of our relationship and also my commitment to my partner and vice versa. I am uncertain if my partner is still interested in me sexually, and that is a major worry that is constantly on my mind. Since I have known my partner for so many years, it is easy to tell when he is being untruthful about his thoughts and feelings. Here lately it seems like he is not attracted to me anymore, and will just tell me what I want to hear without actually being meaningful about his words. I often question if my partner is tired of me and ready for someone new. The only thing I am certain about at this point is our goals regarding our finances and children. I am certain we both stand on the same page when thinking about our commitments we are obligated too which are necessary for survival. We have common goals when it comes to what we would like to achieve in the future. I am certain that my partner would never leave me to fend for myself without warning, in the event he did feel it was best to go separate directions in life.",38,2,2,4,3,6,2.94
"well, i'm certain that my partner is a pretty nice person, and i want to have him in my life in some capacity. he has a lot of good ideas and we've been planning on starting a business together since we've known each other, and i think we would be successful at it if we end up doing it, because we're essentially good friends with the same goals. but i'm uncertain that i want to be in a romantic relationship with my partner, because we've been fighting a lot about stupid things that i think are just based on fundamental differences with us. if we were not romantically involved these things probably wouldn't matter, but because we're so in each other's business all the time, the small differences get annoying. also, because i'm his partner, i feel like i have to preserve his feelings and i can't really be forceful or lead in anything we do together, because if i do that it hurts his ego. maybe if we were just friends, instead of partners, that wouldn't be as much of an issue, because he would see us more as equals. but, i'm also not sure that there's any way to end the romantic part of our relationship and keep the friendship part intact. i don't want to lose my best friend, but i also don't think this relationship is good for either of us as it is.",92,2.5,2,2,4,6,2.81
"We generally don't talk about our relationship anymore because we did that for the entire relationship up until last year when it became clear to me that this relationship is going nowhere. My partner is not psychologically aware of himself, his goals, or what he wants in life, which is completely opposite of myself. He's also a pretty immature and selfish person. I have tried for a long time to get him to go to therapy so that he could work on himself but he just doesn't because he has found comfort in his routine of being depressed and anxious, working the bare minimum to get by (doesn't contribute to savings), and playing video games non-stop on his downtime. I would say the only certainty in our relationship is the uncertainty of everything about it. That, and we still manage to have the best sex of our lives despite nearly hating each other. I am uncertain of everything else. I do not love him the way I used to love him and I think now I only love him because I feel bad for him. I am no longer in love with him. I'm not even sure he loves me. I would have left this relationship years ago but I am not financially able to yet due to some physical and mental health problems I have and I do not have any friends or family or a support system. We are basically staying together for financial ""security"", if you can call it that. He is my friend.. but he's no longer my best friend. I often wonder what I saw in him in the beginning and why I chose to be with him. The only answer I have to that is that I have grown so much in these past 5 years and I am no longer the person I was then.",139,1.5,1,4,2,6,4.81
